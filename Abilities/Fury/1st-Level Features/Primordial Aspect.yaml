effects:
  - effect: You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than
      civilization, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of
      passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape-the Primordial
      Chaos-and that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a
      primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a
      skill. (*Quick Build:* Berserker.)
  - effect: Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
