      You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization,
      older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that
      revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and
      that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a primordial
      aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
      (*Quick Build:* Berserker.)

      - **Berserker:** You channel your ferocity into physical might, acting as
      a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have the Lift
      skill.

      - **Reaver:** You channel your ferocity into instinct and cunning,
      challenging the order of civilization. You have the Hide skill.

      - **Stormwight:** You channel your ferocity into primordial storms and can
      take on the form of an animal or an animal hybrid form. You have the Track
      skill.

      Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
