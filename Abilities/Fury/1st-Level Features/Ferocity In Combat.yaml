  - effect: >-
      At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
      tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain
      ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns
      during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

      Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you
      gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an
      encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

      You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.
