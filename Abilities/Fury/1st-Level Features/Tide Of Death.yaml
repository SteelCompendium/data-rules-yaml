effects:
  - effect: You move up to your speed in a straight line, and enemy squares are not
      difficult terrain for this movement. You can end this movement in a
      creature's space and move them to an adjacent unoccupied space. You make
      one power roll that targets each enemy whose space you move through.
  - roll: Power Roll + Might
    t1: 2 damage
    t2: 3 damage
    t3: 5 damage
  - effect: The last target you damage takes extra damage equal to your Might score
      for each opportunity attack you trigger during your move.
