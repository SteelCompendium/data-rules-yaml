  source: mcdm.heroes.v1
  target: One creature
  type: Main action
effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Might
    t1: 9 + M damage; M < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
    t2: 13 + M damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
    t3: 18 + M damage; M < STRONG, restrained (save ends)
  - effect: While the target is slowed this way, any other effect that would make
      the target slowed instead makes them restrained by this ability.
      Additionally, a creature who fails the saving throw while restrained this
      way is petrified until they are given a supernatural cure or you choose to
      reverse the effect (no action required).
