      Your mastery of elemental forces protects and emboldens you. If you are a
      berserker or reaver, you have immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire,
      lightning, poison, and sonic damage equal to twice your Might score. If
      you are a stormwight, your damage immunity from your Primordial Storm
      feature (see Stormwight Kits) increases to three times your Might score.

      When any elemental or any other creature whose abilities deal acid, cold,
      corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage first becomes aware
      of you in combat, if they have P < STRONG, they are frightened of you
      (save ends).

      Additionally, when you use Primordial Strike, you can spend up to 3
      ferocity, gaining 1 surge per ferocity spent to use for that strike.
