  - effect: Each enemy within 5 squares of you is distracted until the end of the
      round. While a creature is distracted this way, they can't take triggered
      actions or free triggered actions, ability rolls made against them gain an
      edge, and their characteristic scores are considered 1 lower for the
      purpose of resisting potencies.
