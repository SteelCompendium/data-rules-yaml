effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: You vertically push the target up to 4 squares. This forced movement
      ignores the target's stability, and the target takes no damage from
      colliding with creatures or objects. At the end of this movement, the
      target can make a free strike that deals extra damage equal to your Might
      score.
