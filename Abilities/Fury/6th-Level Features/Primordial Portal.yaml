      As a main action, you can touch a magic source of elemental power and use
      it to create a portal to Quintessence. You can then use a main action to
      teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you
      through the portal and onto a safe island in Quintessence, or to teleport
      back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might
      score, each leading to the same safe island in Quintessence. If a portal
      in your network is destroyed, it is no longer part of the network. You can
      remove a portal from your network no matter your distance from it,
      including across different worlds (no action required).

      (Exploring Quintessence is possible from your island, but continued safety
      is not guaranteed.)
