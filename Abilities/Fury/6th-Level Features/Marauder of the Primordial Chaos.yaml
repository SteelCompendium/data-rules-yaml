      As your connection to the power of the Primordial Chaos grows ever
      stronger, you automatically sense any elemental creatures or magic sources
      of elemental power, such as a lava pool or a lake overlapping with
      Quintessence, within 1 mile of you.


      Additionally, you can speak with elemental creatures, and when you are in
      a negotiation with an elemental, you treat your Renown as 1 higher than
      usual. This stacks with the increase to your effective Renown provided by
      the Nature's Knight aspect feature (see 3rd-Level Features). When any
      elemental first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have P < AVERAGE,
      they are frightened of you (save ends).
