      You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your
      fellows' spirits, appealing to the muses to heighten a battle's drama.
      However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain to achieve the
      same end.


      Before you roll to gain drama at the start of your turn, you can make your
      appeal (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following
      additional effects:

      - If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director gains 1d3
      Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*).

      - If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep or
      give to an ally within the distance of your active performance. The
      Director gains 1 Malice.

      - If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 of a Heroic Resource, which you can
      distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your
      active performance.
