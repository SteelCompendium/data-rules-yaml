effects:
  - effect: "A guest star appears to help you during the encounter: either a
      bystander within distance uplifted by your magic, or a mysterious new hero
      who appears in an unoccupied space within distance. This guest star is
      controlled by you, has their own turn, and shares your characteristics.
      Their Stamina maximum is half yours. They have no abilities other than
      your melee and ranged free strikes. At the end of the encounter, or when
      the guest star is reduced to 0 Stamina, they retreat or revert to a
      bystander. The same bystander can't be uplifted this way more than once
      during an encounter."
