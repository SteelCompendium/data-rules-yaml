      As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival (such as a
      calling card or a formal letter) addressed to an enemy. You can deliver
      the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area,
      send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to
      find. You can have only one notice active at a time.

      The Director determines when the target receives your notice. When the
      target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate
      measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per combat
      round during encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such
      encounter with 2 additional hero tokens (Chapter 1: The Basics). These
      hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.
