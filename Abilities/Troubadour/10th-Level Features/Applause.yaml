      You have an epic resource called applause. Each time you finish a respite,
      you gain applause equal to the XP you gain. You can spend applause on your
      abilities as if it were drama.

      Additionally, whenever you or a creature within 3 squares would obtain a
      failure or a tier 1 outcome on a test, you can spend 1 applause to improve
      the outcome by 1 tier.

      Applause remains until you spend it.
