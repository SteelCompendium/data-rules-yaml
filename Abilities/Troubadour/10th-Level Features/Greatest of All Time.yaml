effects:
  - effect: Whenever you obtain a success on a test, each NPC within your line of
      effect has their Impression score decreased by 4 during a negotiation (to
      a minimum of 1), and each ally within 3 squares of you gains an edge on
      their next test. These effects last until you start your next respite.
