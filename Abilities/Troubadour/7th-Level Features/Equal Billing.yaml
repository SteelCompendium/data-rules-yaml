      You can use your Scene Partner feature to form a bond with one willing
      hero instead of an NPC you interact with using a test. If you bond with
      another hero, you lose your existing bond with a hero.

      Additionally, you and creatures you are bonded with gain a +1 bonus to
      saving throws. Whenever you or a bonded creature succeeds on a saving
      throw, you and each creature you are bonded with gains temporary Stamina
      equal to your level.
