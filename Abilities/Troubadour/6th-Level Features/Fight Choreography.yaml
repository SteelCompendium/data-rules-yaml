effects:
  - effect: You and the target each make a melee free strike that targets each enemy
      within 3 squares of either of you, dividing the enemies between each of
      you. You choose which enemies your free strike targets and which enemies
      the target creature's free strike targets. You then slide the target 5
      squares, ignoring stability.
