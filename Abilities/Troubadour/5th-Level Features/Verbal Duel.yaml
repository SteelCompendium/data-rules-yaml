effects:
  - effect: Once on each of your turns while the target of your Foil feature is
      adjacent to you, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with them.
      Make an opposed Presence test with the target. Whoever gets the higher
      result can make a free strike, which deals psychic damage instead of its
      usual damage.
