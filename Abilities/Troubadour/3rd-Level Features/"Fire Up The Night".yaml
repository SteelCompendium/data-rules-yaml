  - effect: "While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in
      the area doesn't take a bane on strikes against creatures with
      concealment. Once during their turn, they can search for hidden creatures
      as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests)."
