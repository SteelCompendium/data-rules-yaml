effects:
  - effect: While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to
      continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a target can
      move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but can't spend
      Recoveries or use triggered actions. At the end of the encounter, each
      target who chose to take turns this way turns to dust and blows away.
