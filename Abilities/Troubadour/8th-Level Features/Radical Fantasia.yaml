  - name: Effect
    effect: While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in
      the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that imposes
      forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement distance until the
      end of their turn. Additionally, once per combat round, each target can
      use a triggered action as a free triggered action.
