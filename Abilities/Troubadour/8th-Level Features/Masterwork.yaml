  - effect: >-
      Choose one of your signature abilities and name it after yourself. You
      always have this ability available, even if it is sourced from a kit you
      switch out. Whenever you use this ability, you gain an edge and 1 surge
      that you can use only on this ability.

      Additionally, when your named signature ability is the last ability you
      use in an encounter, you can immediately use the Hear Ye, Hear Ye! effect
      of your Zeitgeist feature to tell tales of your exploits after the
      encounter ends.
