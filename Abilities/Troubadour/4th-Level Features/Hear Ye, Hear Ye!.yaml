      By bragging, intimidating, leading, or lying, you attempt to spread one
      piece of information into the local area. Make a Presence test:

      - **â‰¤11:** Your information reaches no one.

      - **12-16:** Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town
      size or larger. You and each ally present when you make the test gain an
      edge on Presence tests in that area until one of you spends a Recovery.

      - **17+:** Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town
      size or larger, plus the next closest such population. You and allies
      present for your test gain an edge on Presence tests made in those areas
      until you start your next respite.
