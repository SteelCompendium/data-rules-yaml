      You have more ways of getting the most drama out of a situation. Choose
      two of the following events to add to the events that grant you drama
      during battle:

      - Whenever a creature rolls a natural 2 on a power roll, you gain 2 drama.

      - The first time the Director deals damage to a hero using a Villain
      action or an ability that costs Malice, you gain 2 drama.

      - The first time a hero unwillingly falls 5 or more squares, you gain 2
      drama.

      - The first time a hero deals damage with 3 surges, you gain 2 drama.

      - Whenever a hero spends their last Recovery, you gain 2 drama.

      Alternatively, you can forgo choosing a new event to choose one event you
      already have (including an event gained with this feature). Whenever the
      chosen event grants you drama, you gain 1 additional drama.
