      Whenever you obtain a success on a test to interact with an NPC using a
      skill from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that NPC.
      When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience
      increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a
      negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a
      bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a
      maximum of 5).

      You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a
      bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of
      your active bonds to lose.
