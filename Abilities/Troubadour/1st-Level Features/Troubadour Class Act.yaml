      Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone
      starts somewhere. Your troubadour class act is your art form, summing up
      the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As you go about
      unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife, you choose a troubadour
      class act from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
      (*Quick Build:* Virtuoso.)

      - **Auteur:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to
      manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You have the Brag
      skill.

      - **Duelist:** Drama infuses your every movement done in tandem with
      another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to
      return your passion in kind. You have the Gymnastics skill.

      - **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between
      vibrations and filling the audience with your pathos. You have the Music
      skill and can play an instrument.

      Your troubadour class act is your subclass, and your choice of class act
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
