  - effect: You turn invisible and create a magical illusion of your corpse falling
      in your space. While you are invisible, you gain a +3 bonus to speed and
      you ignore difficult terrain. The illusion and your invisibility last
      until the end of your next turn, or until the illusion is interacted with,
      you take damage, or you use a main action or a maneuver.
