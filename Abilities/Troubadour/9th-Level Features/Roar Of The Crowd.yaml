      You are empowered by your audience, near and far. You can't be made
      frightened, and if you are prone, you can stand up as a free maneuver.

      Additionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining
      Stamina to invoke the roar of an invisible applauding audience. You and
      each ally within 3 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 10 +
      the number of active bonds from your Scene Partner feature + either your
      Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher).
