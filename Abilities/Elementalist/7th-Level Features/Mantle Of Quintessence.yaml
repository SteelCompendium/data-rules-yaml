      Your Mantle of Essence feature no longer requires essence.

      Additionally, your Mantle of Essence now radiates magic that creates a
      calming air. Creatures in the area of the mantle's aura have their
      starting patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5) during any
      negotiation. While in the area, you and any ally gain an edge on tests
      that use the Handle Animals skill. If you have 5 or more Victories, the
      bonus to patience increases to 2 and tests that use the Handle Animals
      skill have a double edge.
