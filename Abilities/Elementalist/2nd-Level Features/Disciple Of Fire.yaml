      Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as
      you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5
      plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's
      fire immunity.

      At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to
      your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can
      make that damage fire damage.
