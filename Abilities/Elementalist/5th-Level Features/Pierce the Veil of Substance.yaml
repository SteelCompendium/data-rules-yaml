      Solidity is merely a suggestion to you. Mundane barriers that are 1 square
      thick or less do not block your senses or line of effect. You can only
      sense or have line of effect past one such barrier at a time.


      Additionally, whenever you use a void ability, you or one ally within
      distance of the ability can teleport a number of squares equal to your
      Reason score.
