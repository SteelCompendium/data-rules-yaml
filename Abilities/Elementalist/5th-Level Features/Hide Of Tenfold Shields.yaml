      Your animal forms become hardier. You gain temporary Stamina equal to your
      level when you enter an animal form in combat, which is added to any
      temporary Stamina provided by the animal form.

      Additionally, an adjacent ally can use a maneuver to pet you. If they do
      so, you can lose temporary Stamina down to a minimum of 0. The ally gains
      temporary Stamina equal to the amount you lost.
