      You can use 1 square of movement to walk into an area of fire your size or
      larger and teleport to any other area of fire your size or larger within
      10 squares of the first area.


      Additionally, whenever you use a fire ability or are targeted by an
      ability that deals fire damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire
      damage equal to your Reason score.
