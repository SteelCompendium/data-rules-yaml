      You stand firm and magnetize your allies to stay grounded. Your stability
      increases by your level.

      Additionally, whenever an ally within distance of your Hurl Element
      ability is force moved, you can use a free triggered action to decrease
      your stability down to a minimum of 0, then increase the ally's stability
      by an amount equal to the stability you lost. This change lasts until the
      end of the round.
