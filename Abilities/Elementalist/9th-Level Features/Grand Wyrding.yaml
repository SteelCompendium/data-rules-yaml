      You have mastered the magic of shaping a wyrd, and can use your Wyrding
      feature as a main action.

      Additionally, when you have 5 or more Victories, choose one of the
      following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison,
      or sonic. You have immunity all to that type.
