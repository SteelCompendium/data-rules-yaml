effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Reason
    t1: You teleport the target up to 4 squares.
    t2: You teleport the target up to 6 squares.
    t3: You teleport the target up to 8 squares.
  - effect: If the target is teleported to a space where they would fall, they
      immediately do so, treating the fall as if their Agility score were 0. The
      target takes fire damage from the fall, and each enemy within 3 squares of
      where they land takes the same amount of fire damage. The ground within 3
      squares of where the target lands is difficult terrain.
