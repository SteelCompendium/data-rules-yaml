  - effect: >-
      At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
      tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence
      equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat,
      you gain 2 essence.

      Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature
      within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain
      1 essence.

      You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.
