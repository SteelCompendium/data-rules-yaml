      Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example,
      the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent
      1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to
      maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the
      ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the
      amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to
      the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent
      effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the
      encounter.


      You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative
      amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an
      ability at any time (no action required).

      If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect
      includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect
      to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a
      persistent ability.

      If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in
      one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if
      you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation,
      taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the
      ability.
