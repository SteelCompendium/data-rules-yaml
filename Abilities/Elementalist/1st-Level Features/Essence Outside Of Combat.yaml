      Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't
      use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
      or more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic
      below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your
      Victories.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
      essence equal to your Victories.
