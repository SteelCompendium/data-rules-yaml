      You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures,
      even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate
      with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but
      you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence
      them.

      Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to
      communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with
      the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and
      sensations that can't be overly specific.
