      You can wear light armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though
      you don't have a kit. While you wear light armor, you gain a +3 bonus to
      Stamina, and that bonus increases by 3 at 4th, 7th, and 10th levels. While
      you wield a light weapon, you gain a +1 damage bonus with weapon
      abilities, including free strikes. You can use light armor treasures and
      light weapon treasures.

      If you have a kit, you can't take this enchantment.
