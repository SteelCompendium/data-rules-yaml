effects:
  - effect: You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a
      5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must
      include the square you touched. Alternatively, you touch a structure made
      of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can
      open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it. You can
      instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or
      smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is sealed
      by the same material that makes up the surface.
