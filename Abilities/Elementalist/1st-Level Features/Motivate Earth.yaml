      You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5
      wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must
      include the square you touched.

      Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal
      that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the
      structure where you touched it. You can instead touch an existing doorway
      or other opening that is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or
      metal surface. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up
      the surface.
