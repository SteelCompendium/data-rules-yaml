      Choose one of the following effects:

      - You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its
      distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use
      Reason instead of Might for the power roll.

      - You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability
      and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire,
      lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type
      equal to your Reason score.

      - You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If
      you choose this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional
      square for each essence spent.
