      The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and
      applies to all your magic abilities.

      Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on
      supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see
      Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.
