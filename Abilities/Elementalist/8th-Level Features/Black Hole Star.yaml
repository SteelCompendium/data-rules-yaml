  - effect: >-
      You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest
      titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one
      creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and
      vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this
      forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced
      movement ignores stability for your allies.

      Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the
      aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal
      to your level.
