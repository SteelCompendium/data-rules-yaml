effects:
  - effect: A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance.
      The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their
      speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is
      dismissed at the start of your next turn. The source starts an encounter
      at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina throughout the
      encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability again. They
      can't regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is
      reduced to 0, you can't use this ability again until you earn 1 or more
      Victories.
  - effect: The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of your
      next turn.
