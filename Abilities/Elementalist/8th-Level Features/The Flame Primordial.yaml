      You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding
      your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they
      take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane
      object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return
      to Formlessness ability instead.

      Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire
      weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn.
      This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is
      wearing mostly metal.
