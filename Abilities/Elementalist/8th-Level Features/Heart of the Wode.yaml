      A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has
      100 Stamina and can't be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree
      to use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when
      you start your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one
      effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end
      of your turn, or you can stand up if you are prone. Each ally within
      distance also gains this benefit.

      Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained
      until the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a
      main action to end the effect early.
