      Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or
      exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your
      Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

      Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can
      select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both
      forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms
      grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain
      the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of
      movement from both forms.

      You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For
      example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but
      you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).
