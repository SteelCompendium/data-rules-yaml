effects:
  - effect: A creature can take the Ride move action only while mounted on another
      creature (see [Mounted Combat](#page-293-0) below). When a creature takes
      the Ride move action, they cause their mount to move up to the mount's
      speed, taking the rider with them. Alternatively, a creature can use the
      Ride move action to have their mount use the Disengage move action as a
      free triggered action. A creature can use the Ride move action only once
      per round. A mounted creature can only have this move action applied to
      them once per round. This movement can be broken up with the rider's
      maneuver and main action however they wish.
