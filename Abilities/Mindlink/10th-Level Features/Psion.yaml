effects:
  - effect: >-
      At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 + 2 clarity
      instead of 1d3 + 1.

      Additionally, you can choose to not take damage from having negative
      clarity. You can also choose to take on any ability's strained effect even
      if you're not strained.
