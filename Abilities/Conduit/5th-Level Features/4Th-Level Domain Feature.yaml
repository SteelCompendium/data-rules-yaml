      ###### Blessing of Life

      Your divine presence causes those you deem worthy to recover quickly from
      a fight. Whenever an ally within distance of your Healing Grace ability
      regains Stamina, they regain additional Stamina equal to your Intuition
      score.

      ###### Blessing of Secrets

      You have the following ability.

      ###### Blessing of Secrets

      *You project an illusory aura that makes you and allies harder to notice.*

      | **Magic**     |                          **Maneuver** |

      | ------------- | ------------------------------------: |

      | **📏 3 aura** | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |
  - effect: >-
      Each creature in the area has a double edge on tests made to hide or
      sneak. The aura lasts until you end it (no action required) or until a
      target harms or deals damage to a creature or object.

      ###### Impervious Touch

      As a maneuver, you can touch an object with a size equal to your Intuition
      score or smaller and place a protective spell on it. The object has
      immunity all to untyped damage. You can maintain this spell on a number of
      objects equal to your Intuition score, and you can end the spell on any
      object at any time (no action required).

      Additionally, you can place this spell on a building or vehicle (or a
      similar structure with the Director's approval) that is of a size larger
      than your Intuition score. You can place the spell on only one such target
      at a time, and you can maintain the spell on a larger target and a number
      of objects equal to your Intuition score simultaneously.

      ###### Improved Hands of the Maker

      When you use your Hands of the Maker ability, you can create a mundane
      object that is size 2 or smaller.

      ###### Improved Sanctified Weapon

      The weapon improved by your Sanctified Weapon feature grants a +3 bonus to
      rolled damage instead of +1.

      ###### Invocation of the Heart

      As a main action, you forge a bond of love and friendship with a willing
      creature you touch. While this bond is active, you can telepathically
      speak with the creature over any distance, including across different
      worlds. Additionally, while this bond is active, you can attempt to assist
      the creature with any test they make regardless of their proximity to you.
      You can maintain only one bond at a time, and you can end a bond at any
      time (no action required).

      ###### Light of Revelation

      As a maneuver, you make your body shine brightly, illuminating your space
      and each square within 5 squares. This light shines through any darkness.
      Hidden creatures in the area are automatically revealed, and creatures in
      the light, including you, can't hide. While this feature is active, you
      gain an edge on tests made to notice hidden objects and entrances and to
      detect supernatural illusions.

      ###### Oracular Warning

      Each time you finish a respite, you can share the vague dreams of the
      future granted to you by the gods with allies who finished the respite
      with you. These premonitions help you and your allies stay alive, granting
      each of you temporary Stamina equal to 10 + your level that lasts until
      you finish a respite.

      ###### Seance

      You can commune with a network of spirits. As a respite activity, you
      speak the name of a creature who died and isn't undead. If the creature's
      spirit is free and willing to speak with you, they appear and you can have
      a conversation with them. During this time, the creature responds to you
      as they would have in life. If the creature isn't free or willing to
      appear, you can speak another name or choose another respite activity.

      ###### Saint's Epiphany

      At the start of a respite, you can inspire yourself or another creature
      taking the same respite with divine knowledge. If the target makes a
      project roll during this respite, they can add 1d10 plus your Intuition
      score to the roll.

      ###### Windwalk

      While you have 5 or more Victories, you can fly. If you can already fly,
      you have a +2 bonus to speed while flying instead.

      ###### Wode Road

      As a main action, you touch a living tree and make it part of a divine
      transportation network. You can maintain a number of trees in your network
      equal to your Intuition score. Whenever you touch any tree in your
      network, you can use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing
      creatures within 10 squares of you to a tree in your network on the same
      world. If a tree in your network dies, it is no longer part of the
      network. You can remove a tree from your network no matter your distance
      from it, including across different worlds (no action required).
