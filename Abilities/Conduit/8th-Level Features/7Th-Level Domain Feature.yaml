      ##### Blessing of Iron

      The gods send divine favor to you and your allies. While you are not
      dying, enemies take a bane on strikes against you or any ally within 3
      squares of you.

      ##### Covenant of the Heart

      You can maintain bonds with up to three willing creatures using your
      Invocation of the Heart feature. Additionally, you have the following
      ability.

      ###### Guided to Your Side

      *You concentrate on a friend and teleport to them.*

      | **Magic, Ranged** |           **Main action** |

      | ----------------- | ------------------------: |

      | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self and each ally** |
  - effect: >-
      Each target is teleported to unoccupied spaces within 5 squares of a
      willing creature who you are bonded to with your Invocation of the Heart
      feature. You don't need line of effect to the bonded creature but you must
      be on the same world.

      ##### Divine Quartermaster

      Each time you finish a respite, you can choose a treasure with a project
      goal equal to 50 times your level or less. You gain a divine version of
      this treasure that lasts until you finish another respite or it is
      consumed.

      ##### Font of Grace

      Each time you use your Healing Grace ability, you gain 1 piety that can be
      spent only on that ability during the same turn. If you don't use this
      piety, it is lost. Additionally, you can use your Minor Miracle feature to
      return a creature to life even if you don't have their remains.

      ##### Gods' Library

      You can gain access to information you need through prayer, so that you no
      longer require research materials for crafting and research projects (see
      Chapter 12: Downtime Projects). Additionally, you add your level to
      project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. You also have
      any skills in the lore skill group you don't already have, and you gain a
      number of skills from any other skill groups equal to the number of skills
      you had in the lore skill group before you gained this feature.

      ##### Light of the Burning Sun

      Sun infuses your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal rolled damage
      to another creature, that ability deals an extra 5 fire damage, or an
      extra 15 fire damage if the creature is undead. Additionally, you have
      fire immunity equal to your level, which is added to any other fire
      immunity you have.

      ##### Nature's Bounty

      When you finish a respite, you can prepare a magic meal using local flora
      for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following
      benefits for creatures who consume the meal:

      - Each creature gains immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning,
      poison, or sonic damage equal to your level. You can choose this benefit
      twice, choosing a different damage immunity each time.

      - Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina.

      - Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.

      - Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.

      - Each creature gains an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.

      Each benefit lasts until the creature who gains it finishes another
      respite.

      ##### Thunderstruck

      Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to
      deal lightning or sonic damage to another creature, you gain 1 surge.
      Additionally, if you use an ability that force moves a creature, the
      forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Intuition score.

      ##### Trinity of Trickery

      You have the following ability.

      ###### Trinity of Trickery (9 Piety)

      *Hey! I'm over here. No, here, numbskull.*

      | **Magic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |

      | ----------------- | ----------------------: |

      | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |
  - effect: >-
      You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere
      within distance. These duplicates last until the end of the encounter. On
      each of their turns, the target can move each duplicate up to their speed.
      If the target is targeted by an ability, they can use a free triggered
      action to switch places with a duplicate within their line of effect,
      making the duplicate the target of the ability instead. When either
      duplicate takes damage, it is destroyed.

      ##### Word of Death Deferred

      You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within distance
      of your Healing Grace ability dies and you are not dying, you can use a
      free triggered action to instead have that ally fall unconscious until
      they regain Stamina.

      Additionally, your abilities deal an extra 5 damage to winded creatures.

      ##### Word of Fate Denied

      When an ally within 10 squares takes damage that would leave them dying,
      you can use a free triggered action to make yourself or another willing
      creature within 10 squares of you the target of the triggering damage
      instead. The creature you choose takes the damage and suffers any effects
      associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.

      ##### Your Triumphs Are Remembered

      The gods allow you and your companions to bask in the glory of past
      successes. Whenever you finish a respite, you and any other heroes who
      rested with you regain 1 Victory after your Victories are converted to XP.
      This Victory isn't converted into XP at the end of a subsequent respite.
