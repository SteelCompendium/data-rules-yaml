      You are now an avatar of your god! When you use your Prayer feature, you
      can be affected by up to three prayers at once, and you can change all
      those prayers and your ward as a respite activity. You can also use a
      maneuver to activate one of your domain effects (see Domain Piety and
      Effects) without needing to pray.

      Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
      in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
      can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer
      honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
      cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
      allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
      your deity.
