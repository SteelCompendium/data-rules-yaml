      You conjure a size 4 dragon that appears in an unoccupied space within
      distance. The dragon has speed 6 and can fly, stability 4, 100 Stamina,
      immunity all to fire damage, and uses your characteristics. The dragon
      disappears at the end of the encounter, if their Stamina drops to 0, or if
      you are dying.

      On subsequent turns, you can use a main action to command the dragon to
      breathe magic fire in a 3 cube within 1 square of them. Make the following
      power roll targeting each enemy in the area.
  - effect: Additionally, you can use a maneuver to move the dragon up to their
      speed, or to make a melee weapon strike with their claw against an
      adjacent creature or object. The dragon can also make this strike as a
      free strike.
