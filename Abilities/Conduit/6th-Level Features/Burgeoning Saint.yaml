effects:
  - effect: >-
      You are infused with the power your deity reserves for their most worthy
      instruments. You have the following benefits:

      - You gain an edge on Presence tests made to interact with other
      creatures.

      - Whenever you deal damage to an enemy, you can spend a Recovery.

      - You have corruption immunity 10 or holy immunity 10 (your choice).

      - Your clothing and equipment changes in a way that reflects your status
      as your deity's chosen champion, such as ordinary robes turning into gold
      vestments or a simple dagger becoming a wicked blade with intricate
      etching.
