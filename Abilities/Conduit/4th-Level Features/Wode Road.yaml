effects:
  - effect: As a main action, you touch a living tree and make it part of a divine
      transportation network. You can maintain a number of trees in your network
      equal to your Intuition score. Whenever you touch any tree in your
      network, you can use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing
      creatures within 10 squares of you to a tree in your network on the same
      world. If a tree in your network dies, it is no longer part of the
      network. You can remove a tree from your network no matter your distance
      from it, including across different worlds (no action required).
