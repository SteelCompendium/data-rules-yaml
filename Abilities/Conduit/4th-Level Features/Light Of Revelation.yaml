effects:
  - effect: As a maneuver, you make your body shine brightly, illuminating your
      space and each square within 5 squares. This light shines through any
      darkness. Hidden creatures in the area are automatically revealed, and
      creatures in the light, including you, can't hide. While this feature is
      active, you gain an edge on tests made to notice hidden objects and
      entrances and to detect supernatural illusions.
