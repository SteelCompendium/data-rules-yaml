effects:
  - effect: Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time
      you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points.
      Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1
      fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an
      edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a
      respite.
