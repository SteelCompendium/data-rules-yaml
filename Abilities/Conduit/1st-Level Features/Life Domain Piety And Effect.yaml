      You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10
      squares regains Stamina.

      - **Prayer Effect:** Choose yourself or one ally within 10 squares. That
      character can spend a Recovery, can end one effect on them that is ended
      by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or can stand up
      if they are prone. Alternatively, you or one ally within 10 squares gains
      temporary Stamina equal to two times your Intuition score.
