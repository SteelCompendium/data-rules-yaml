      You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the
      last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just
      a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might
      need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you.
      The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but
      the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the
      effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

      ##### Hands of the Maker

      You have the following ability.

      ###### Hands of the Maker

      *You craft objects with the power of your mind.*

      You create a mundane object of size 1S or smaller. You can maintain a
      number of objects created this way equal to your Intuition score. You can
      destroy an object created this way with a thought, no matter how far you
      are from it (no action required).

      ##### Inner Light

      Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is
      also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place
      a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a
      +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.

      ##### Inspired Deception

      The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that
      uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Intuition
      on the test instead of another characteristic.

      ##### Oracular Visions

      Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you
      earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points.
      Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1
      fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an
      edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a
      respite.

      ##### Protective Circle

      You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on
      the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for
      24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action
      required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle
      can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature
      can't be targeted by strikes.

      ##### Revitalizing Ritual

      Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is
      also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The
      chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level
      that lasts until you finish another respite.

      ##### Sanctified Weapon

      As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the
      weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the
      weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.
