effects:
  - effect: You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within
      the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are
      just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you
      might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with
      you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy,
      but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the
      effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.
