      Your god gives your mind the training of a soldier. You can wear light
      armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don't have a
      kit. While you wear light armor, you gain a +3 bonus to Stamina, and that
      bonus increases by 3 at 4th, 7th, and 10th levels. While you wield a light
      weapon, you gain a +1 damage bonus with weapon abilities, including free
      strikes. You can use light armor treasures and light weapon treasures.

      If you have a kit, you can't take this blessing.
