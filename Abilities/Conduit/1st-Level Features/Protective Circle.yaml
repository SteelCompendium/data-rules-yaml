effects:
  - effect: You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on
      the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for
      24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action
      required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle
      can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature
      can't be targeted by strikes.
