      Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use
      that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
      more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had
      spent an amount of piety equal to your Victories.
