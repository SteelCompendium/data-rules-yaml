effects:
  - effect: You summon a spirit of size 2 who can't be harmed, and who appears in an
      unoccupied space within distance. The spirit lasts until the end of your
      next turn. You and your allies can move through the spirit's space, but
      enemies can't. Any enemy who moves within 2 squares of the spirit for the
      first time in a combat round or starts their turn there takes holy damage
      equal to your Intuition score.
