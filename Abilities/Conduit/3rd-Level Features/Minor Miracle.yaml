      As a respite activity, you can perform a religious ritual and beseech the
      gods to restore a dead creature to life. You must have at least half the
      creature's remains, and they must have died within the last 24 hours from
      an effect that isn't age related. The creature's soul must be willing to
      return to life for the ritual to work. If they are not willing, you
      instinctively understand that as you start the respite activity and can
      cease it immediately.


      A creature with a willing soul returns to life at the end of the respite
      with full Stamina and half their Recoveries. You regain only half your
      Recoveries at the end of the respite.
