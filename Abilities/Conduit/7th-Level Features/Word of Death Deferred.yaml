      You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within distance
      of your Healing Grace ability dies and you are not dying, you can use a
      free triggered action to instead have that ally fall unconscious until
      they regain Stamina.

      Additionally, your abilities deal an extra 5 damage to winded creatures.
