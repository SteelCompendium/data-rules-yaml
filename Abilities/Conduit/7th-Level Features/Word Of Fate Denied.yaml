effects:
  - effect: When an ally within 10 squares takes damage that would leave them dying,
      you can use a free triggered action to make yourself or another willing
      creature within 10 squares of you the target of the triggering damage
      instead. The creature you choose takes the damage and suffers any effects
      associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.
