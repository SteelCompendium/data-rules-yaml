effects:
  - effect: Each time you use your Healing Grace ability, you gain 1 piety that can
      be spent only on that ability during the same turn. If you don't use this
      piety, it is lost. Additionally, you can use your Minor Miracle feature to
      return a creature to life even if you don't have their remains.
