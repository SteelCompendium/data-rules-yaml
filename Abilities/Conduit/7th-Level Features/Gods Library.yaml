effects:
  - effect: "You can gain access to information you need through prayer, so that you
      no longer require research materials for crafting and research projects
      (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects). Additionally, you add your level to
      project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. You also have
      any skills in the lore skill group you don't already have, and you gain a
      number of skills from any other skill groups equal to the number of skills
      you had in the lore skill group before you gained this feature."
