      You can better sift through the constant fragmentary visions from your
      deity and act to make them manifest. Each time you earn 1 or more
      Victories, you can make a number of 2d10 rolls equal to the number of
      Victories you earned. Record each roll in order. Then whenever you or a
      creature within 10 squares makes a power roll, you can use a free
      triggered action to replace the total on the dice with your first recorded
      roll.

      You discard each roll as it is used, and each time you earn Victories, you
      add new rolls to the bottom of the list. Any unused rolls are discarded
      when you finish a respite.
