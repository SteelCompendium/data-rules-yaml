effects:
  - effect: Your order has taught you methods to discern the disguises of both
      mortals and monsters. You automatically see through disguises and
      illusions created by creatures of your level or lower, and you gain an
      edge on tests made to see through the disguises and illusions of more
      powerful creatures. Whenever you see through a creature's disguise or
      illusion, you can use your Judgment ability against them as a free
      triggered action.
