effects:
  - effect: You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen.
      The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically
      interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit,
      you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in
      addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at
      any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are
      dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any
      way.
