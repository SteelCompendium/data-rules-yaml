      You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially
      engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another
      creature with a test.

      Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC
      of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and
      the first test made to influence them gains an edge.
