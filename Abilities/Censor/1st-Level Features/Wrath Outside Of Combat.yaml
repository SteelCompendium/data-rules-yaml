      Though you can't gain wrath outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost wrath without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs wrath, you can't use
      that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
      more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      wrath on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of wrath
      equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for
      the censor, but they might appear in future products.)
