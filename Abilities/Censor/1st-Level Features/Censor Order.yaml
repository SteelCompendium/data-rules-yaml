effects:
  - effect: Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act
      as your god's agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you
      choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you
      a skill. (*Quick Build:* Paragon.)
  - effect: Your censor order is your subclass, and your choice of order determines
      many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
