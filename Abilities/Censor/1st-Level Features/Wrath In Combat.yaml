  - effect: >-
      At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
      tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain wrath
      equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat,
      you gain 2 wrath.

      Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature judged by
      you (see [Judgment](#page-94-0) below) deals damage to you, you gain 1
      wrath. The first time each combat round that you deal damage to a creature
      judged by you, you gain 1 wrath.

      You lose any remaining wrath at the end of the encounter.
