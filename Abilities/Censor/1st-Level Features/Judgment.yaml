effects:
  - effect: "The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you use
      this ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action required), or
      another censor judges the target. Whenever a creature judged by you uses a
      main action and is within your line of effect, you can use a free
      triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to
      them. When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a
      free triggered action to use this ability against a new target.
      Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free
      triggered actions: - When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to
      shift, you make a melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0
      until the end of the current turn, preventing them from shifting. - When a
      creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you cause
      them to take a bane on the roll. - When a creature judged by you within 10
      squares uses an ability with a potency that targets only one creature, the
      potency is reduced by 1 for that creature. - If you damage a creature
      judged by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until
      the end of their next turn. You can choose only one free triggered action
      option at a time, even if multiple options are triggered by the same
      effect."
