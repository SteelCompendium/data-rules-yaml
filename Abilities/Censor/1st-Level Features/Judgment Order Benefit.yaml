      The first time on a turn that you use your Judgment ability to judge a
      creature, you gain the following benefit based on your order:

      - **Exorcist:** You can teleport up to a number of squares equal to twice
      your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged
      creature. You do not need line of effect to your destination.

      - **Oracle:** You can deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score
      to the judged creature.

      - **Paragon:** You can vertical pull the judged creature up to a number of
      squares equal to twice your Presence score.
