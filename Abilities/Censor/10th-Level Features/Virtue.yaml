      You have an epic resource called virtue. Each time you finish a respite,
      you gain virtue equal to the XP you gain. You can spend virtue on your
      abilities as if it were wrath.

      Additionally, you can spend 3 virtue to access one of your deity's domains
      that you usually don't have access to. When you do, you can use that
      domain's features until you finish another respite.

      Virtue remains until you spend it.
