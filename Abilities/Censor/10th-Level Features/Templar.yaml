      You are the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the
      timescape. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can use a free
      triggered action to use a conduit domain effect (see [Domain Piety and
      Effects](#page-110-0) in the [Conduit](#page-108-0) section) associated
      with your chosen domain, or a domain you access with virtue (see below).
      If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your
      Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your
      censor level instead.

      Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
      in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
      can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must

      answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
      cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
      allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
      your deity.

      While you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority
      targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge
      on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal
      to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you
      suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.
