effects:
  - effect: As a main action, you touch a living tree and make it part of a divine
      transportation network. You can maintain a number of trees in your network
      equal to your Presence score. Whenever you touch any tree in your network,
      you can use a main action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures
      within 10 squares of you to a tree in your network on the same world. If a
      tree in your network dies, it is no longer part of the network. You can
      remove a tree from your network no matter your distance from it, including
      across different worlds (no action required).
