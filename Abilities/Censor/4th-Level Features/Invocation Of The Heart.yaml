effects:
  - effect: As a main action, you forge a bond of love and friendship with one
      willing creature you touch. While this bond is active, you can
      telepathically speak with the creature over any distance, including across
      different worlds. Additionally, while this bond is active, you can attempt
      to assist the creature with any test they make regardless of their
      proximity to you. You can maintain only one bond at a time, and you can
      end a bond at any time (no action required).
