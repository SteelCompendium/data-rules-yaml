      As a maneuver, you can touch an object with a size equal to your Presence
      score or smaller and place a protective spell on it. The object has
      immunity all to untyped damage. You can maintain this spell on a number of
      objects equal to your Presence score, and you can end the spell on any
      object at any time (no action required).

      Additionally, you can place this spell on a building or vehicle (or a
      similar structure with the Director's approval) that is of a size larger
      than your Presence score. You can place the spell on only one such target
      at a time, and you can maintain the spell on a larger target and a number
      of objects equal to your Presence score simultaneously.
