effects:
  - effect: Your constant fragmentary visions become clearer, and can be honed to
      understand the past of creatures you interact with. While speaking with
      any creature, you can make a medium Presence test to see visions from
      their past. On a success, you see a clear view of any subject related to
      the creature's past that you wish to understand. On a success with a
      consequence, you see two visions, one false and one true. On a failure,
      you lose 2d6 Stamina.
