effects:
  - effect: The most esoteric secrets of your order teach you that to defeat your
      enemy, you must understand them. You treat your Renown as 2 higher than
      usual when dealing with demons, devils, and other agents of chaos. If you
      successfully complete a negotiation with one of these creatures, you gain
      an edge on power rolls made against them and can use your Judgment ability
      against them as a free triggered action before an encounter begins.
