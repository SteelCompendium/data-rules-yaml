effects:
  - effect: Your judgment has grown in divine power, instilling fear in those you
      condemn. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can spend 1 wrath,
      and if the target has P < AVERAGE, they are frightened of you (save ends).
      Additionally, whenever a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina
      and you use Judgment as a free triggered action, if the new target has P <
      STRONG, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already
      frightened of you, they instead take holy damage equal to twice your
      Presence score.
