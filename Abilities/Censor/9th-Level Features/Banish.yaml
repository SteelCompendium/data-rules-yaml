  target: One creature

effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Might
    tier1: 5 + M damage; P < WEAK, the target is banished (save ends)
    tier2: 8 + M damage; P < AVERAGE, the target is banished (save ends)
    tier3: 11 + M damage; P < STRONG, the target is banished (save ends)
  - name: Effect
    effect: This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures
      not native to your current world. If you know the target's true name, this
      ability has a double edge. While banished, the target is sent to another
      manifold in the timescape and removed from the encounter map. A banished
      target can do nothing but make saving throws, and takes 10 holy damage
      each time they do so. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina while
      banished, they are lost to the timescape.
