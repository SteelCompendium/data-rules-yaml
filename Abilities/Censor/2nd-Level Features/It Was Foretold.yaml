effects:
  - effect: Your order has trained you to understand fragments of the visions
      granted to you by your deity, giving you a momentary advantage in
      challenging situations. At the start of an encounter, you can take one
      main action before any other creature and before your first turn.
      Additionally, whenever the Director calls for a montage test, you can make
      one free test before the montage begins, which counts as an earned success
      or failure as usual.
