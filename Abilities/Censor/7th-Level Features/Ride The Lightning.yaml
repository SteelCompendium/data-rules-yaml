effects:
  - effect: Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to
      deal rolled damage to another creature, the ability deals extra lightning
      damage equal to your Presence score. Additionally, if you use an ability
      that force moves a creature, the forced movement distance gains a bonus
      equal to your Presence score. While you are under the effect of your
      Windwalk feature, lightning enhances your locomotion to grant you a bonus
      to speed equal to your Might score. If Windwalk already grants you a bonus
      to speed, this bonus adds to that.
