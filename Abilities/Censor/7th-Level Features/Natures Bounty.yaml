      When you finish a respite, you can prepare a magic meal using local flora
      for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following
      benefits for creatures who consume the meal:

      - Each creature gains immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning,
      poison, or sonic damage equal to your level. You can choose this benefit
      twice, choosing a different damage immunity each time.

      - Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina.

      - Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.

      - Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.

      - Each creature gains an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.

      Each benefit lasts until the creature who gains it finishes another
      respite.
