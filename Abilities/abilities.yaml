          When a creature takes the Charge main action, they move up to their speed
          in a straight line, then make a melee free strike (see [Free
          Strikes](#page-289-1) below) against a target when they end their move. If
          the creature has an ability with the Charge keyword, they can use that
          ability against the target instead of a free strike.
    
          A creature can't move through difficult terrain or shift when they charge.
          They can fly or burrow as part of the Charge main action if they have that
          movement available to them, but they can't climb or swim while charging
          unless they can automatically use that movement at full speed.

          Complex or time-consuming tests might require a main action if made in
          combat-or could take so long that they can't be made during combat at all.
          Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Reason test to recall lore
          about mummies, are usually free maneuvers in combat. The Director has the
          final say regarding which tests can be made as maneuvers.

          the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and
          sensations that can't be overly specific.

      - effect: >-
          Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example,
          the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent
          1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to
          maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the
          ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the
          amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to
          the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent
          effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the
          encounter.
    
          You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative
          amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an
          ability at any time (no action required).
    
          If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect
          includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect
          to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a
          persistent ability.
    
          If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in
          one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if
          you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation,
          taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the
          ability.

          Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can
          select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both
          forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms
          grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain
          the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of
          movement from both forms.
    
          You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For

          A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has
          100 Stamina and can't be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree
          to use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when
          you start your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one
          effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end
          of your turn, or you can stand up if you are prone. Each ally within
          distance also gains this benefit.
    
          Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained
          until the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a
          main action to end the effect early.

          A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance.
          The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their
          speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is
          dismissed at the start of your next turn.
    
          The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their
          current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and
          you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the
          encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you can't use this
          ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.

          You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest
          titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one
          creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and
          vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this
          forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced
          movement ignores stability for your allies.
    
          Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the
          aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal
          to your level.

          You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding
          your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they
          take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane
          object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return
          to Formlessness ability instead.
    
          Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire
          weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn.
          This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is
          wearing mostly metal.

          You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a freeform magic spell
          for a variety of situations. Choose one of the following magical effects:
    
          - You create a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason score or
          smaller.
    
          - You construct a place of shelter suitable for twenty creatures that
          lasts for 24 hours and can't be detected by enemies.
    
          - You restore all Stamina to a mundane object of a size equal to your
          Reason score or smaller.
    
          - Choose a cube with a size up to your Reason score within 5 squares. You
          can fill that area with difficult terrain or natural phenomena such as
          fire, water, or plant life, or can clear the area of those things.
    
          - You can preserve a corpse or up to 5 pounds of food for a week, or can
          cause a corpse or that amount of food to instantly rot.
    
          - You create a seal on a surface that can't be seen or felt by anyone but
          you. When a creature comes adjacent to the surface, you can see and hear
          through the seal for as long as the creature remains adjacent to it. When
          you create the seal, you can decide to limit the number of creatures who
          activate it by choosing a creature keyword (such as Undead) or a specific
          name (such as Ajax the Invincible) or organization (such as the Black Iron
          Pact). If you do, the seal alerts you only when creatures with the
          keyword, name, or organizational affiliation you provide pass by it. If
          you create a second seal, the first one disappears. You can dispel a seal
          at any time (no action required).

          You have damage immunity 5.
    
          Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth
          around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains,
          level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise
          islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use
          this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using
          it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10
          days.

          The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish
          a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2
          additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when
          they finish their next respite.
    
          Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes
          a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a
          treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an
          existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow
          these magic consumables on its own.
    
          As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an
          adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all
          their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and
          they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their
          aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit
          and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the
          creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for
          the longest time.

          Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as
          you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5
          plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's
          fire immunity.
    
          At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to
          your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can
          make that damage fire damage.

          You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially
          engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another
          creature with a test.
    
          Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC
          of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and
          the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

          You have an epic resource called divine power. Each time you finish a
          respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend
          divine power on your abilities as if it were piety.
    
          Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any
          conduit abilities you don't have, as the gods answer your prayers with
          temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have
          that usually costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.
    
          Divine power remains until you spend it.

          You are now an avatar of your god! When you use your Prayer feature, you
          can be affected by up to three prayers at once, and you can change all
          those prayers and your ward as a respite activity. You can also use a
          maneuver to activate one of your domain effects (see Domain Piety and
          Effects) without needing to pray.
    
          Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
          in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
          can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer
          honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
          cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
          allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
          your deity.

          As a respite activity, you can perform a religious ritual and beseech the
          gods to restore a dead creature to life. You must have at least half the
          creature's remains, and they must have died within the last 24 hours from
          an effect that isn't age related. The creature's soul must be willing to
          return to life for the ritual to work. If they are not willing, you
          instinctively understand that as you start the respite activity and can
          cease it immediately.
    
          A creature with a willing soul returns to life at the end of the respite
          with full Stamina and half their Recoveries. You regain only half your
          Recoveries at the end of the respite.

          equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for

          Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act as
          your god's agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you
          choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you
          a skill. (*Quick Build:* Paragon.)
    
          - **Exorcist:** You specialize in hunting your order's hidden enemies,
          knowing that an open mind is an unguarded fortress. You have the Read
          Person skill.
    
          - **Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed, leading you
          to specialize in uncovering clandestine threats to your order. You have
          the Magic skill.
    
          - **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be
          corrupted. You specialize in setting an example for your order. You have
          the Lead skill.
    
          Your censor order is your subclass, and your choice of order determines
          many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

          ability against a new target. Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take
          one of the following free triggered actions:
    
          - When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you make a
          melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0 until the end of
          the current turn, preventing them from shifting.
    
          - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you
          cause them to take a bane on the roll.
    
          - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability with a
          potency that targets only one creature, the potency is reduced by 1 for
          that creature.
    
          - If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the
          creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
    
          You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time, even if
          multiple options are triggered by the same effect.

          including your own, to channel supernatural power as an implement of your
          god's wrath. The weapon becomes magic and gains the following benefits
          until your next respite:
    
          - Strikes with the weapon deal extra holy damage equal to the wielder's
          highest characteristic score.
    
          - Any creature struck by the weapon who has holy weakness and has P <
          STRONG is frightened and weakened (save ends).
    
          - Any minion targeted by a strike using the weapon dies. That minion's
          Stamina maximum is removed from the minion Stamina pool before any damage
          is applied to the rest of the squad.
    
          - The weapon's wielder can't be made frightened.

    effects:
      - effect: >-
          You are the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the
          timescape. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can use a free
          triggered action to use a conduit domain effect (see [Domain Piety and
          Effects](#page-110-0) in the [Conduit](#page-108-0) section) associated
          with your chosen domain, or a domain you access with virtue (see below).
          If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your
          Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your
          censor level instead.
    
          Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
          in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
          can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must
    
          answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
          cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
          allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
          your deity.
    
          While you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority
          targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge
          on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal
          to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you
          suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.

          Through extensive physical and psionic training, you have learned to
          unlock the full potential of your body. As you shape the growth of your
          power, you choose a null tradition from the following options, each of
          which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Chronokinetic and the Monsters
          skill.)
    
          - **Chronokinetic:** Your training unmoors you from temporal reality,
          allowing you to use the flow of time as another dimension that all things
          move through. You gain one skill from the lore group.
    
          - **Cryokinetic:** You can tap into absolute cold, the most essential
          energy of myriad manifolds, and manifest its effects in your body. You
          gain one skill from the crafting group.
    
          - **Metakinetic:** You learn to see through the illusions of the universe
          to more fully understand your body and its psionic potential. You gain one
          skill from the exploration group.
    
          Your null tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition
          determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

          Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your
          heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it.
          Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs
          discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat
          again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
          discipline equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the
          core rules for the null, but they might appear in future products.)

          Your body becomes perfected matter, beyond the whims and chaos of the
          timescape and the restrictions of the manifolds. Each time you finish a
          respite, you can shift yourself and any creatures in the area of your Null
          Field ability to any location in the timescape known to you, known to any
          other creature in the area, or where any supernatural treasure in the area
          has been before.
    
          Whenever you use an ability, you gain 1 discipline that can be used only
          to apply a benefit from your Psi Boost feature to that ability.
          Additionally, you and allies in the area of your Null Field ability ignore
          banes and double banes on your power rolls.

          If the ability force moves a target, the forced movement distance gains a
          bonus equal to your Intuition score.
    
          ##### Expanded Power (3 Discipline)
    
          If the ability targets an area, you increase the size of the area by 1. If
          the area is a line, you increase the size of one dimension, not both.
    
          ##### Extended Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability is ranged, the distance gains a bonus equal to your
          Intuition score. If the ability is melee, the distance gains a +2 bonus.
    
          ##### Heightened Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability deals rolled damage, it deals extra damage equal to your
          Intuition score.
    
          ##### Magnified Power (5 Discipline)
    
          If the ability has a potency, you increase that potency by an amount equal
          to your Intuition score.
    
          ##### Shared Power (5 Discipline)
    
          If the ability targets individual creatures or objects, you target one
          additional creature or object within distance.
    
          ##### Sharpened Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability has any power roll, that roll gains an edge.

          At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain
          ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns
          during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.
    
          Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you
          gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an
          encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.
    
          You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.

          You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization,
          older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that
          revealed the building blocks of the timescape-the Primordial Chaos-and
          that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a primordial
          aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
          (*Quick Build:* Berserker.)
    
          - **Berserker:** You channel your ferocity into physical might, acting as
          a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have the Lift
          skill.
    
          - **Reaver:** You channel your ferocity into instinct and cunning,
          challenging the order of civilization. You have the Hide skill.
    
          - **Stormwight:** You channel your ferocity into primordial storms and can
          take on the form of an animal or an animal hybrid form. You have the Track
          skill.
    
          Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect
          determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

          back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might

          Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you

          that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
          more Victories or finish a respite.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus

          **Tactician Abilities Explained**
    
          Many of the tactician's abilities grant allies extra movement, damage, and
          actions. But what's happening in the fiction to allow this? The tactician
          is an incredible strategist and inspiring leader who is quick to give
          commands and inspiration that causes their allies to act. The tactician
          can quickly read the battlefield, analyze enemies, and then bark orders
          and encouragement that pushes their allies to greatness. Many of the names
          of the tactician's abilities are the actual commands they give their
          friends!

          You have drilled with a broad array of arms and armor, and have developed
          techniques to optimize their use. You can use and gain the benefits of two
          kits, including both their signature abilities. Whenever you would choose
          or change one kit, you can choose or change your second kit as well. See
          Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor,
          Sniper.)
    
          If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and
          can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means
          taking the higher of two bonuses.)
    
          For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the
          following benefits overall:
    
          - Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon
    
          - Stability Bonus: +1
    
          - Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
    
          - Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4
    
          - Speed Bonus: +1
    
          - Ranged Distance Bonus: +10
    
          - Disengage Bonus: +1
    
          - You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.
    
          Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which
          might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you
          gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which
          gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which
          gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the
          Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from
          the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing
          its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to
          3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13
          damage.

          Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that
          knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you
          treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one
          category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such
          projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12:
          Downtime Projects for more information.)
    
          Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or
          negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the
          encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite
          activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:
    
          - **≤11:** The Director tells you the number of creatures in the
          encounter.
    
          - **12-16:** The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures
          in the encounter.
    
          - **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when
          the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.
    
          The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:
    
          - **≤11:** The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs
          to an NPC in the negotiation.
    
          - **12-16:** The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the
          negotiation.
    
          - **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you
          and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs
          during the negotiation.
    
          You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

          Warfare is as old as civilization-and perhaps even older. As battle became
          ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining
          how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be
          learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly
          through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to
          your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical
          doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
          (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)
    
          - **Insurgent:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in
          battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your
          allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.
    
          - **Mastermind:** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing
          the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps
          ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
    
          - **Vanguard:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting
          you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will
          and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.
    
          Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine
          determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

          The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are
          dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your
          mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a
          creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you
          is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new
          target within distance.
    
          You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other
          tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same
          time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you
          to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.
    
          While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and
          allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against
          that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to
          deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to
          gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:
    
          - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.
    
          - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.
    
          - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares
          equal to your Reason score.
    
          - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the
          creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn. You can't
          gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.

          At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama
          equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat,
          you gain 1d3 drama.
    
          Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during a combat
          encounter:
    
          - The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn, you
          gain 2 drama.
    
          - The first time any hero is made winded during the encounter, you gain 2
          drama.
    
          - Whenever a creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20,
          you gain 3 drama.
    
          - When you or another hero dies, you gain 10 drama.
    
          When you are dead, you continue to gain drama during combat as long as
          your body is intact. If you have 30 drama during the encounter in which
          you died, you can come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action
          required). If you are still dead after the encounter in which you died,
          you can't gain drama during future encounters.
    
          You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

          Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone
          starts somewhere. Your troubadour class act is your art form, summing up
          the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As you go about
          unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife, you choose a troubadour
          class act from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
          (*Quick Build:* Virtuoso.)
    
          - **Auteur:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to
          manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You have the Brag
          skill.
    
          - **Duelist:** Drama infuses your every movement done in tandem with
          another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to
          return your passion in kind. You have the Gymnastics skill.
    
          - **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between
          vibrations and filling the audience with your pathos. You have the Music
          skill and can play an instrument.
    
          Your troubadour class act is your subclass, and your choice of class act
          determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

          Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use
          that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
          more Victories or finish a respite.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had
          spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.

          **The Auteur Troubadour**
    
          Abilities like Guest Star, Missed Cue, and Twist at the End allow the
          auteur to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by temporarily
          removing creatures from an encounter, bringing people back to life, or
          causing a new ally to appear. These abilities and features are no more
          powerful than any other, but they're narratively different from shooting
          rays of fire or swinging a sword.
    
          This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in *Draw Steel*, the
          auteur knows that the combat encounter playing out at your table is really
          a story being told sometime later, probably in a tavern.
    
          When the auteur uses these abilities, they are changing that story. They
          rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the telling. What *actually*
          happened is a matter of some debate. Even the people who were there don't
          agree on exactly what took place. How people *remember* it is what's
          important!
    
          This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it's too weird for you or your
          table, you could always interpret those abilities as a kind of magic. A
          school of conjuring that really does change the battlefield, which the
          auteur merely *flavors* as rewriting the story.

          skill from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that NPC.
          When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience
          increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a
          negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a
          bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a
          maximum of 5).
    
          You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a
          bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of
          your active bonds to lose.

      - effect: The target is split into two separate entities, one of which remains in
          the target's space while the other appears in an unoccupied space of your
          choice within distance. If the target is a creature, this creates a new
          creature under the Director's control. Each entity has half the original
          target's Stamina, is weakened, and takes 1d6 corruption damage at the
          start of each of their turns. If either entity is reduced to 0 Stamina,
          the other entity persists as the original entity and this effect ends. The
          effect also ends if both entities occupy the same space, causing them to
          automatically merge and combine their current Stamina.

          You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your

          However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain to achieve the

          Before you roll to gain drama at the start of your turn, you can make your

          additional effects:

          Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*).
    
          - If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep or
          give to an ally within the distance of your active performance. The
          Director gains 1 Malice.
    
          - If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 of a Heroic Resource, which you can
          distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your

          Until the end of the encounter, both you and the target can target each
          other with abilities even if you are beyond distance, with the distance of
          this ability replacing those abilities' distances. The target can't be
          force moved by an ability used beyond distance this way.
    
          Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to
          communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either
          granting them 2 surges or forcing them to take a bane on the next ability
          roll they make before the start of your next turn.

          two of the following events to add to the events that grant you drama
          during battle:
    
          - Whenever a creature rolls a natural 2 on a power roll, you gain 2 drama.
    
          - The first time the Director deals damage to a hero using a Villain
          action or an ability that costs Malice, you gain 2 drama.
    
          - The first time a hero unwillingly falls 5 or more squares, you gain 2
          drama.
    
          - The first time a hero deals damage with 3 surges, you gain 2 drama.
    
          - Whenever a hero spends their last Recovery, you gain 2 drama.
    
          Alternatively, you can forgo choosing a new event to choose one event you
          already have (including an event gained with this feature). Whenever the
          chosen event grants you drama, you gain 1 additional drama.

          You envelop yourself in an illusion that makes you appear nonthreatening
          and harmless to your enemies. You might take on the appearance of a
          harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might
          appear as a less heroic and unarmed version of yourself. While this
          illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge, and when you take the Disengage
          move action, you gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift.
    
          The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you physically
          interact with a creature, when you use this ability again, or when you end
          the illusion (no action required). If you end this illusion by harming
          another creature, you gain 1 surge.

      - effect: Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and
          who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that
          creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and
          armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of the creature. You gain
          an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the

          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't

          or more Victories or finish a respite.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if
          you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.

          Your illusions make your enemies believe you are their friend in critical
          moments. Whenever an enemy uses an ability or trait that targets multiple
          allies and you are within distance of the effect, you can choose to be a
          target of the effect as well.
    
          Additionally, when you use your I'm No Threat ability, you can take the
          Disengage move action as part of that ability.

          At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to
          create 1d6 clones of yourself in unoccupied adjacent spaces. A clone acts
          on your turn and uses your statistics, except they have 1 Stamina. They
          are affected by any conditions and effects on you, and last until the
          start of your next turn. A clone doesn't have insight and can't use the
          Careful Observation ability, the Umbral Form feature, or any triggered
          actions. On their turn, a clone has a move action, a maneuver, and a main
          action that they can use only to make a free strike. While making a free
          strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren't also
          striking.
    
          Outside of combat, you can have one clone active for every 2 Victories you
          have. If a clone is destroyed, you must wait 1 hour before creating
          another one.

          Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't
          use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
          or more Victories or finish a respite.
    
          Additionally, whenever you use any ability or effect that costs clarity
          within 1 minute of using another such ability, you take 1d6 damage and
          incur any strain effect from using the new ability.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you
          had spent an amount of clarity equal to your Victories.

          - **Animapathy** abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the
          souls of living things.
    
          - **Chronopathy** abilities allow you to view future and past events, and
          to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
    
          - **Cryokinesis** abilities allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute
          cold to enemies and the environment alike.
    
          - **Metamorphosis** abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your
          body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.
    
          - **Pyrokinesis** abilities allow you to create and manipulate fire by
          interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
    
          - **Resopathy** abilities allow you to manipulate matter and space to
          create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects
          in it.
    
          - **Telekinesis** abilities allow you to physically manipulate creatures
          and objects.
    
          - **Telepathy** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and
          influence the minds of other creatures.
    
          You choose a talent tradition from the following options: chronopathy,
          telekinesis, or telepathy. Your talent tradition is your subclass, and
          your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as
          you gain new levels. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future
          products.) (*Quick Build:* Telekinesis.)

          Whenever you use an ability that is a main action or a maneuver with the

          it and enhance its effects. A psi boost's effects only last until the end

          boosts to an ability, but only one instance of each specific boost. You
          can use the following psi boosts.
    
          ##### Dynamic Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability force moves a target, the forced movement distance gains a
          bonus equal to your Reason score.
    
          ##### Expanded Power (3 Clarity)
    
          If the ability targets an area, you increase the size of the area by 1. If
          the area is a line, you increase the size of one dimension, not both.
    
          ##### Extended Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability is ranged, the distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason
          score. If the ability is melee, the distance gains a +2 bonus.
    
          ##### Heightened Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability deals rolled damage, it deals extra damage equal to your
          Reason score.
    
          ##### Magnified Power (5 Clarity)
    
          If the ability has a potency, you increase that potency by an amount equal
          to your Reason score.
    
          ##### Shared Power (5 Clarity)
    
          If the ability targets individual creatures or objects, you target one
          additional creature or object within distance.
    
          ##### Sharpened Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability has any power roll, that roll gains an edge.

          As a maneuver, you project your mind outside your body. While you are in
          this state, your body remains unconscious and prone, and your mind is a
          separate entity with size 1T. Your mind automatically has concealment, and
          can freely move through solid matter. If you end your turn inside solid
          matter, you are forced out into the space where you entered it.
    
          Any abilities or features you use originate from your mind. Both your mind
          and your body can take damage while separated, with any such damage
          applied to your Stamina. Your mind is instantly forced back into your body
          if you take any damage, and you can immediately return to your body as a
          free maneuver.
