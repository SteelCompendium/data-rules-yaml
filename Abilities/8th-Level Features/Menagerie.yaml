effects:
  - effect: You can use all stormwight kits. During a respite, you can choose to
      swap your stormwight kit and still take another respite activity. Your
      Nature's Knight feature now lets you automatically sense the presence of
      animals within 1 mile of you. Additionally, whenever you make a test to
      track another creature, you can roll three dice and choose which two to
      use.
