effects:
  - effect: Each target takes acid, fire, or poison damage (your choice) equal to
      your Agility score. For each combat round that has passed since this
      ability was last used in the current encounter, the area increases by 1
      and you gain 1 surge that must be used with this ability. After using the
      ability or at the end of the encounter, its area and surges are reset.
  - effect: "**Spend 2+ Insight**: For every 2 insight spent, you increase the
      cube's size by 1 and gain 1 surge that can be used only with this
      ability."
