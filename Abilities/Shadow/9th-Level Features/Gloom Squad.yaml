      At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to
      create 1d6 clones of yourself in unoccupied adjacent spaces. A clone acts
      on your turn and uses your statistics, except they have 1 Stamina. They
      are affected by any conditions and effects on you, and last until the
      start of your next turn. A clone doesn't have insight and can't use the
      Careful Observation ability, the Umbral Form feature, or any triggered
      actions. On their turn, a clone has a move action, a maneuver, and a main
      action that they can use only to make a free strike. While making a free
      strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren't also
      striking.

      Outside of combat, you can have one clone active for every 2 Victories you
      have. If a clone is destroyed, you must wait 1 hour before creating
      another one.
