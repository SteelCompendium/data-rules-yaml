      Although you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't
      use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
      or more Victories or finish a respite.


      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if
      you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.
