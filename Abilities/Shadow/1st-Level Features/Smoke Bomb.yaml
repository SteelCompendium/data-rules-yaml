effects:
  - effect: You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to use for distractions and
      easy getaways. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and
      don't initially have cover or concealment. When you do so, you can shift a
      number of squares equal to your Agility score. If you end this movement
      with cover or concealment, you are automatically hidden.
