  - effect: >-
      You envelop yourself in an illusion that makes you appear nonthreatening
      and harmless to your enemies. You might take on the appearance of a
      harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might
      appear as a less heroic and unarmed version of yourself. While this
      illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge, and when you take the Disengage
      move action, you gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift.

      The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you physically
      interact with a creature, when you use this ability again, or when you end
      the illusion (no action required). If you end this illusion by harming
      another creature, you gain 1 surge.
    name: Effect
  - effect: Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and
      who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that
      creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and
      armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of the creature. You gain
      an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the
      creature.
