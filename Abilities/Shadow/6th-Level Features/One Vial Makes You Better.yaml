      You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target, who can immediately quaff
      the potion (no action required). If they don't drink the potion right
      away, they must use the Use Consumable maneuver to consume it later. The
      potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter.

      A creature who drinks the potion can spend up to 2 Recoveries, and has
      acid immunity, fire immunity, or poison immunity (their choice) equal to
      your level until the end of the encounter.
