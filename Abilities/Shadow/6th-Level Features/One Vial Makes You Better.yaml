effects:
  - effect: You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target, who can immediately
      quaff the potion (no action required). If they don't drink the potion
      right away, they must use the Use Consumable maneuver to consume it later.
      The potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter. A creature who
      drinks the potion can spend up to 2 Recoveries, and has acid immunity,
      fire immunity, or poison immunity (their choice) equal to your level until
      the end of the encounter.
