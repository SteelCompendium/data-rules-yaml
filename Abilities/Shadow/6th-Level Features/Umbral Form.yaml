effects:
  - effect: >-
      As a maneuver, you lose control of yourself, becoming a shadow creature
      dripping with ash. This transformation lasts until the end of the
      encounter, until you are dying, or after 1 uninterrupted hour of quiet
      focus outside of combat. You gain the following effects while in this
      form:

      - You can automatically climb at full speed while moving.

      - Enemies' spaces don't count as difficult terrain for you. An enemy takes
      corruption damage equal to your Agility score the first time you pass
      through their space on a turn.

      - If you end your turn with cover or concealment from another creature,
      you are automatically hidden from that creature.

      - You gain 1 surge at the start of each of your turns.

      - You have corruption immunity equal to 5 + your level.

      - Creatures gain an edge on strikes against you.

      - You take a bane on Presence tests made to interact with other creatures.
