      You gain full control over the shadow creature you become with your Umbral
      Form feature, and you can end the transformation at will (no action
      required). Additionally, you are always wreathed in darkness that grants
      you concealment while in this form, and creatures no longer gain an edge
      on strikes against you.


      While you are in your umbral form, you can spend 1 uninterrupted minute
      concentrating on a location where you've been before. At the end of that
      minute, you and each willing creature of your choice within 10 squares of
      you can teleport to unoccupied spaces of your choice within that location.
      Each creature who teleports this way is invisible for 1 hour or until they
      use an ability.
