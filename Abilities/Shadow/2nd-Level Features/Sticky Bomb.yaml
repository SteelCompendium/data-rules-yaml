effects:
  - effect: You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the
      creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature
      otherwise notices the bomb and can disarm and remove it as a main action.
      If they don't, at the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. When the
      bomb detonates, you make a power roll targeting each enemy within 2
      squares of it.
  - roll: Power Roll + Agility
    t1: 4 + A fire damage
    t2: 7 + A fire damage
    t3: 11 + A fire damage
