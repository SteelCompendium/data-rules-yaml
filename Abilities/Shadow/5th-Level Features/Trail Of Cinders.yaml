      Whenever you reduce a non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can
      immediately use a free maneuver to use your Black Ash Teleport ability.

      Additionally, you can now bring an adjacent willing creature along with
      you whenever you use a shadow ability to teleport. The creature appears in
      an unoccupied space adjacent to the space into which you teleported. If no
      such space exists, they can't teleport with you.
