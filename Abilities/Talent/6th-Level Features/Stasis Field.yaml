      The area is frozen in time until the start of your next turn. Each object
      in the area is restrained and can't fall until the effect ends. Until the
      effect ends, creatures in the area who are reduced to 0 Stamina or would
      die stay alive, and objects in the area that are reduced to 0 Stamina
      remain undestroyed.

      Make a power roll that targets each enemy in the area.
  - roll: Power Roll + Presence
    t1: P < WEAK, the target is slowed until the effect ends
    t2: P < AVERAGE, the target's speed is 0 until the effect ends
    t3: P < STRONG, the target is restrained until the effect ends
  - effect: Any creature or object force moved in the area takes 2 corruption damage
      for each square of the area they enter. Creatures and objects restrained
      in the area can be force moved. You are restrained until the effect ends.
