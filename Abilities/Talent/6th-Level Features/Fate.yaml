effects:
  - effect: The target has damage weakness 5 until the end of your next turn.
      Whenever the target takes damage while they have this weakness, they are
      knocked prone.
  - effect: This ability gains the Strike keyword as the vision hurts the target's
      psyche. You make a power roll, then are weakened (save ends).
