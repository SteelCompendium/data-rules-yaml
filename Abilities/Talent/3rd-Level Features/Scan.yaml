  - effect: "You can extend your psionic senses beyond their usual range. Once on
      each of your turns, you can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver
      (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests). Additionally, once you establish
      line of effect to a thinking creature within distance of your Mind Spike
      ability, you always have line of effect to that creature until they move
      beyond that distance."
