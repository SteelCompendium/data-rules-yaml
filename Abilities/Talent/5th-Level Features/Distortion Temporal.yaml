effects:
  - effect: While you are not dying, time behaves irregularly around you in a 3
      aura. That area is difficult terrain for enemies. Additionally, when an
      ally enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their
      turn there, they gain a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the turn.
