  target: Two enemies
  type: Main action
effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Presence
    t1: 8 damage; A < WEAK, the target is stitched to the other target (save ends)
    t2: 13 damage; A < AVERAGE, the target is stitched to the other target (save
      ends)
    t3: 17 damage; A < STRONG, the target is stitched to the other target (save
      ends)
  - effect: If any target becomes stitched to the other, both targets are stitched
      together. While stitched together, a target takes a bane on power rolls
      while not adjacent to a creature they're stitched to. Whenever a stitched
      target takes damage that wasn't dealt by or also taken by another stitched
      target, each other stitched target takes half the damage the initial
      target took.
  - effect: You target yourself and three enemies instead.
