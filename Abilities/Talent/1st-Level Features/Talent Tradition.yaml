      Psionic abilities are grouped into categories according to their effects,
      with each category comprising one of many talent traditions:

      - **Animapathy** abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the
      souls of living things.

      - **Chronopathy** abilities allow you to view future and past events, and
      to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.

      - **Cryokinesis** abilities allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute
      cold to enemies and the environment alike.

      - **Metamorphosis** abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your
      body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.

      - **Pyrokinesis** abilities allow you to create and manipulate fire by
      interacting with the potential energy found in all things.

      - **Resopathy** abilities allow you to manipulate matter and space to
      create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects
      in it.

      - **Telekinesis** abilities allow you to physically manipulate creatures
      and objects.

      - **Telepathy** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and
      influence the minds of other creatures.

      You choose a talent tradition from the following options: chronopathy,
      telekinesis, or telepathy. Your talent tradition is your subclass, and
      your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as
      you gain new levels. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future
      products.) (*Quick Build:* Telekinesis.)
