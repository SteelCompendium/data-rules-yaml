effects:
  - effect: The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced
      movement until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target enters a
      square while under this effect, they can push one adjacent creature up to
      a number of squares equal to your Reason score. When pushing an ally, the
      target can ignore that ally's stability. A creature can only be force
      moved this way once a turn.
    name: Effect
