effects:
  - effect: As your ferocity manifests elemental forces created by the Primordial
      Chaos, you are aware of how elemental power interacts with those around
      you. You automatically sense whether any creature within 10 squares has
      damage immunity or damage weakness to acid, cold, corruption, fire,
      lightning, poison, or sonic damage, learning whether they have immunity or
      weakness, the value of that immunity or weakness, and the specific damage
      type. Additionally, you automatically sense any source of one of those
      damage types within 10 squares, such as a fire or a source of elemental
      power.
