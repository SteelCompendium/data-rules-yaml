effects:
  - effect: Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability
      increases by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, you
      ignore difficult terrain and reduce the potency of enemy effects targeting
      you by 1 for you. You can also use a free triggered action at the start of
      each of your turns to end one effect on you that is ended by a saving
      throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Each ally in the area also
      gains these benefits.
