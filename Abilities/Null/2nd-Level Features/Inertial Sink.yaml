  - effect: >-
      You add your Intuition score to your effective size for the purpose of
      interacting with creatures and objects, such as for determining whether
      you can lift an object, whether you are affected by forced movement, and
      so forth. This has no effect on whether you can be grabbed.

      Additionally, when you fall, you reduce the effective height of the fall
      by 5 squares in addition to any other reductions. Whenever you take damage
      from being force moved, you reduce that damage by an amount equal to your
      level.
