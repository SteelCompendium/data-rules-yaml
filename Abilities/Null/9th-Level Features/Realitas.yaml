  target: One creature
  type: feature/ability/null/9th-level-feature
effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Agility
    t1: 7 + A psychic damage; I < WEAK, dazed
    t2: 10 + A psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, dazed
    t3: 13 + A psychic damage; I < STRONG, dazed
  - effect: While dazed this way, the target takes psychic damage equal to twice
      your Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. If this ability
      causes a creature who is not a leader or solo creature to become winded,
      they are instead reduced to 0 Stamina. Any creature reduced to 0 Stamina
      by this ability is forgotten by all creatures of your level or lower in
      the timescape who are not present in the encounter. Loved ones of the
      forgotten creature retain a faint sense of melancholy. This effect can be
      reversed only at the Director's discretion.
