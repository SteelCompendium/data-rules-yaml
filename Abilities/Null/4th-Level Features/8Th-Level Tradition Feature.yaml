      Your null tradition grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level
      Tradition Features table.

      ###### 8th-Level Tradition Features Table

      | Tradition     | Feature           |

      | ------------- | ----------------- |

      | Chronokinetic | Shared Momentum   |

      | Cryokinetic   | Synaptic Triage   |

      | Metakinetic   | Inertial Dampener |

      ##### Inertial Dampener

      You and each creature or object of your choice in the area of your Null
      Field ability gain a bonus to stability equal to your Intuition score. A
      creature who attempts to force move a target with this bonus takes psychic
      damage equal to your Intuition score.

      ##### Shared Momentum

      When you take the Disengage move action, one ally in the area of your Null
      Field ability can also take the Disengage move action as a free triggered
      action, using your distance for that move action.

      ##### Synaptic Triage

      As a free maneuver, you can spend 1d6 Stamina to remove one effect on you.
      Each creature of your choice in the area of your Null Field ability also
      gains this benefit.
