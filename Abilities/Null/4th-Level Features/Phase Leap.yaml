effects:
  - effect: You jump up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Until
      the end of your next turn, a static afterimage of you remains in the space
      you left, and any enemy adjacent to your afterimage takes a bane on
      ability rolls. You can use your abilities from your own space or from the
      space of your afterimage as if you were still there. Additionally, if your
      Null Field ability is active, your afterimage also projects the aura from
      that ability, which you control as if you were in the afterimage's space.
