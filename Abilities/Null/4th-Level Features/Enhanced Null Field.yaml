effects:
  - effect: While using your Null Field ability, you disrupt magic and psionic power
      suffusing the area around you. During combat, any temporary supernatural
      terrain effects of your level or lower are removed when your aura
      partially or fully overlaps with their location. Permanent supernatural
      terrain effects of your level or lower are temporarily negated while your
      aura overlaps with their location, but return when the aura no longer
      overlaps with them.
