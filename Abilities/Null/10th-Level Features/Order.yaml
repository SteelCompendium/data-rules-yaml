      You have an epic resource called order. Each time you finish a respite,
      you gain order equal to the XP you gain. You can spend order on your
      abilities as if it were discipline.

      At the start of a combat encounter, you can spend 1 order to increase the
      size of your Null Field by 1 until the end of the encounter.

      Order remains until you spend it.
