      Your body becomes perfected matter, beyond the whims and chaos of the
      timescape and the restrictions of the manifolds. Each time you finish a
      respite, you can shift yourself and any creatures in the area of your Null
      Field ability to any location in the timescape known to you, known to any
      other creature in the area, or where any supernatural treasure in the area
      has been before.

      Whenever you use an ability, you gain 1 discipline that can be used only
      to apply a benefit from your Psi Boost feature to that ability.
      Additionally, you and allies in the area of your Null Field ability ignore
      banes and double banes on your power rolls.
