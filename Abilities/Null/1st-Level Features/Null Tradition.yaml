effects:
  - effect: Through extensive physical and psionic training, you have learned to
      unlock the full potential of your body. As you shape the growth of your
      power, you choose a null tradition from the following options, each of
      which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Chronokinetic and the Monsters
      skill.)
  - effect: Your null tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
