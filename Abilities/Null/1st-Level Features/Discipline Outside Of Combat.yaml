      Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your
      heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it.
      Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs
      discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat
      again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
      discipline equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the
      core rules for the null, but they might appear in future products.)
