      Each target reduces their potencies by 1.

      Once as a free maneuver on each of your turns, you can spend 1 discipline
      and give your Null Field one of the following additional effects until the
      start of your next turn: - Gravitic Disruption: The first time on a turn
      that a target takes damage, you can slide them up to 2 squares. - Inertial
      Anchor: Any target who starts their turn in the area can't shift. -
      Synaptic Break: Whenever you or any ally uses an ability against a target
      that has a potency effect, the potency is increased by 1.

      This ability remains active even after an encounter ends. It ends only if
      you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).
