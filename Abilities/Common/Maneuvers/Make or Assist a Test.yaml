      Many tests are maneuvers if made in combat. Searching a chest with a
      Reason test, picking a door's lock with an Agility test, or lifting a
      portcullis with a Might test would all be maneuvers. Assisting a test is
      also a maneuver in combat (see Assist a Test in Chapter 9: Tests).


      Complex or time-consuming tests might require a main action if made in
      combatâ€”or could take so long that they can't be made during combat at all.
      Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Reason test to recall lore
      about mummies, are usually free maneuvers in combat. The Director has the
      final say regarding which tests can be made as maneuvers.
