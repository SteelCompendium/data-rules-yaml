      A creature who uses the Catch Breath maneuver spends a Recovery and
      regains Stamina equal to their recovery value. (See below for
      [Stamina.](#page-291-0) See [Recoveries](#page-21-3) in [Chapter 1: The
      Basics](#page-17-3).)


      A creature who is dying (see [Dying and Death](#page-292-1) in
      [Stamina](#page-291-0) below) can't use the Catch Breath maneuver, but
      other creatures can help them spend Recoveries in other ways.
