effects:
  - effect: "When a creature takes the Defend main action, ability rolls made
      against them have a double bane until the start of their next turn.
      Additionally, you have a double edge on tests when called for to resist
      environmental effects or a creature's traits or abilities. A creature
      gains no benefit from this action while another creature is taunted by
      them (see [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2))."
