      When a creature takes the Charge main action, they move up to their speed
      in a straight line, then make a melee free strike (see [Free
      Strikes](#page-289-1) below) against a target when they end their move. If
      the creature has an ability with the Charge keyword, they can use that
      ability against the target instead of a free strike.


      A creature can't move through difficult terrain or shift when they charge.
      They can fly or burrow as part of the Charge main action if they have that
      movement available to them, but they can't climb or swim while charging
      unless they can automatically use that movement at full speed.
