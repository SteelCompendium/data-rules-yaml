      A creature seeking to keep a foe close and locked down can attempt to grab
      a creature using the following ability.

      ###### Grab

      | **Melee, Weapon** |        **Maneuver** |

      | ----------------- | ------------------: |

      | **📏 Melee 1**    | **🎯 One creature** |
  - roll: Power Roll + Might
    t1: No effect.
    t2: You can grab the target, but if you do, the target can make a melee free
      strike against you before they are grabbed.
    t3: The target is grabbed by you.
  - effect: >-
      You can usually target only creatures of your size or smaller. If your
      Might score is 2 or higher, you can target any creature with a size equal
      to or less than your Might score.

      Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a
      time.

      See [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2) for
      information on the grabbed condition.
