  - effect: You can create a temporary source of elemental power as a respite
      activity. This source of elemental power lasts 24 hours after creation,
      and can be used to create a portal to Quintessence with your Primordial
      Portal feature. If you do so, the source of elemental power lasts as long
      as the portal is maintained in your network.
