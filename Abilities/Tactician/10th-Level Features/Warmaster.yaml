      You have mastered the entirety of possible strategies and tactics.
      Whenever you or any ally makes an ability roll against a target marked by
      you, the character making the roll can roll three dice and choose which
      two to use.

      Additionally, whenever an ally uses a heroic ability that targets one or
      more creatures marked by you, they spend 2 fewer of their Heroic Resource
      on that ability (minimum 1).
