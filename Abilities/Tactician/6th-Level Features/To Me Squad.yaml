  - roll: Power Roll + Might
    t1: 6 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can use the Charge main action as a
      free triggered action, and can use a melee strike signature ability
      instead of a free strike for the charge
    t2: 9 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can use the Charge main action as a
      free triggered action, and can use a melee strike signature ability that
      gains an edge instead of a free strike for the charge
    t3: 13 + M damage; two allies within 10 squares can use the Charge main action
      as a free triggered action, and can each use a melee strike signature
      ability that gains an edge instead of a free strike for the charge
  - effect: If the target is hit with two or more strikes as part of this ability
      and they have R < STRONG, they are dazed (save ends). If the target is
      reduced to 0 Stamina before one or both allies has made their strike, the
      ally or allies can pick a different target.
