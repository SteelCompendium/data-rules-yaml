      You have drilled with a broad array of arms and armor, and have developed
      techniques to optimize their use. You can use and gain the benefits of two
      kits, including both their signature abilities. Whenever you would choose
      or change one kit, you can choose or change your second kit as well. See
      Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor,
      Sniper.)

      If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and
      can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means
      taking the higher of two bonuses.)

      For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the
      following benefits overall:

      - Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon

      - Stability Bonus: +1

      - Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2

      - Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4

      - Speed Bonus: +1

      - Ranged Distance Bonus: +10

      - Disengage Bonus: +1

      - You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.

      Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which
      might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you
      gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which
      gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which
      gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the
      Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from
      the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing
      its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to
      3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13
      damage.
