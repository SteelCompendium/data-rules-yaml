      Warfare is as old as civilizationâ€”and perhaps even older. As battle became
      ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining
      how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be
      learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly
      through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to
      your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical
      doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.
      (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)

      - **Insurgent:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in
      battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your
      allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.

      - **Mastermind:** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing
      the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps
      ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.

      - **Vanguard:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting
      you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will
      and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.

      Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
