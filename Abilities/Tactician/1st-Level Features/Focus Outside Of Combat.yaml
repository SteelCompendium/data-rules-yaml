      Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use
      that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
      more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus
      equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for
      the tactician, but they might appear in future products.)

      > Many of the tactician's abilities grant allies extra movement, damage,
      and actions. But what's happening in the fiction to allow this? The
      tactician is an incredible strategist and inspiring leader who is quick to
      give commands and inspiration that causes their allies to act. The
      tactician can quickly read the battlefield, analyze enemies, and then bark
      orders and encouragement that pushes their allies to greatness. Many of
      the names of the tactician's abilities are the actual commands they give
      their friends!
