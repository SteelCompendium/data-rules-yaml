      Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that
      knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you
      treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one
      category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such
      projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12:
      Downtime Projects for more information.)


      Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or
      negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the
      encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite
      activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:
    t1: The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
    t2: The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the
      encounter.
    t3: The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the
      encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.
  - effect: "The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:"
    t1: The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC in
      the negotiation.
    t2: The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.
    t3: The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each of
      your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the
      negotiation.
  - effect: You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.
