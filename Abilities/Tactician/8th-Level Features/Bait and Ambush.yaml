effects:
  - effect: You have trained your squad to be silent ambushers.
  - effect: When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you,
      you can spend 2 focus to let the character making the strike shift up to a
      number of squares equal to your Reason score and use the Hide maneuver as
      a free maneuver once during the shift. The creature can shift before or
      after the strike is resolved.
