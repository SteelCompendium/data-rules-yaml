  - effect: Your expertise with weapons has grown to true mastery. Whenever you use
      a signature ability from one of your equipped kits or make a free strike
      using a weapon from one of your equipped kits, you automatically obtain a
      tier 3 outcome on the power roll. You can still roll to determine if you
      score a critical hit.
