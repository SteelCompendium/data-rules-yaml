effects:
  - effect: You have mastered the ability to distract your foes, allowing you and
      your allies to take advantage of their gaps in attention. Whenever you or
      any ally attempts to hide, any creature marked by you doesn't count as an
      observer. Additionally, you and your allies can use other allies as cover
      for the purpose of hiding.
