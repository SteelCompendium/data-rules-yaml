      - effect: >-
          When a creature takes the Charge main action, they move up to their speed
          in a straight line, then make a melee free strike (see [Free
          Strikes](#page-289-1) below) against a target when they end their move. If
          the creature has an ability with the Charge keyword, they can use that
          ability against the target instead of a free strike.
    
    
          A creature can't move through difficult terrain or shift when they charge.
          They can fly or burrow as part of the Charge main action if they have that
          movement available to them, but they can't climb or swim while charging
          unless they can automatically use that movement at full speed.

          might use the Ranged Weapon Free Strike ability with an improvised weapon
          when battling a flying foe.

          them once per round. This movement can be broken up with the rider's

          Many tests are maneuvers if made in combat. Searching a chest with a
          Reason test, picking a door's lock with an Agility test, or lifting a
          portcullis with a Might test would all be maneuvers. Assisting a test is
          also a maneuver in combat (see Assist a Test in Chapter 9: Tests).
    
    
          Complex or time-consuming tests might require a main action if made in
          combat—or could take so long that they can't be made during combat at all.
          Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Reason test to recall lore
          about mummies, are usually free maneuvers in combat. The Director has the
          final say regarding which tests can be made as maneuvers.

          A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has
          100 Stamina and can't be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree
          to use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when
          you start your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one
          effect on yourself that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end
          of your turn, or you can stand up if you are prone. Each ally within
          distance also gains this benefit.
    
          Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained
          until the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a
          main action to end the effect early.

          Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following benefits:
    
          - Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target becoming
          size 3. Each creature who is within the target's new space slides to the
          nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability. If the target doesn't have
          space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until
          the effect ends.
    
          - They have fire immunity 10.
    
          - Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.
    
          - When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement
          distance gains a +2 bonus.
    
          - They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might
          power rolls.

          A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance.
          The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their
          speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is
          dismissed at the start of your next turn.
    
          The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their
          current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and
          you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the

          ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.

          the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are
          just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you
          might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with
          you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy,
          but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the
          effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

          The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you use this
          ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action required), or
          another censor judges the target.
    
          Whenever a creature judged by you uses a main action and is within your
          line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage
          equal to twice your Presence score to them.
    
          When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free
          triggered action to use this ability against a new target.
    
          Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free
          triggered actions:
    
          - When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you make a
          melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0 until the end of
          the current turn, preventing them from shifting.
    
          - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you
          cause them to take a bane on the roll.
    
          - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability with a
          potency that targets only one creature, the potency is reduced by 1 for
          that creature.
    
          - If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the
          creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
    
          You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time, even if
          multiple options are triggered by the same effect.

          Whenever you use an ability that is a main action or a maneuver with the
          Psionic keyword, you can spend additional discipline to apply a psi boost
          to it and enhance its effects. A psi boost's effects only last until the
          end of the turn which the ability is first used. You can apply multiple
          psi boosts to an ability, but only one instance of each specific boost.
          You can use the following psi boosts.
    
    
          ##### Dynamic Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability force moves a target, the forced movement distance gains a
          bonus equal to your Intuition score.
    
          ##### Expanded Power (3 Discipline)
    
          If the ability targets an area, you increase the size of the area by 1. If
          the area is a line, you increase the size of one dimension, not both.
    
          ##### Extended Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability is ranged, the distance gains a bonus equal to your
          Intuition score. If the ability is melee, the distance gains a +2 bonus.
    
          ##### Heightened Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability deals rolled damage, it deals extra damage equal to your
          Intuition score.
    
          ##### Magnified Power (5 Discipline)
    
          If the ability has a potency, you increase that potency by an amount equal
          to your Intuition score.
    
          ##### Shared Power (5 Discipline)
    
          If the ability targets individual creatures or objects, you target one
          additional creature or object within distance.
    
          ##### Sharpened Power (1 Discipline)
    
          If the ability has any power roll, that roll gains an edge.

        effect: >-
          The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are
          dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your
          mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a
          creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you
          is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new
          target within distance.
    
          You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other
          tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same
          time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you
          to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.
    
          While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and
          allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against
          that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to
          deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to
          gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:
    
          - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.
    
          - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.
    
          - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares
          equal to your Reason score.
    
          - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the
          creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
    
          You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.

          You envelop yourself in an illusion that makes you appear nonthreatening
          and harmless to your enemies. You might take on the appearance of a
          harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might
          appear as a less heroic and unarmed version of yourself. While this
          illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge, and when you take the Disengage
          move action, you gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift.
    
          The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you physically
          interact with a creature, when you use this ability again, or when you end
          the illusion (no action required). If you end this illusion by harming
          another creature, you gain 1 surge.
      - cost: Spend 1 Insight
        effect: Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and
          who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that
          creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and
          armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of the creature. You gain
          an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the

          Whenever you use an ability that is a main action or a maneuver with the
          Psionic keyword, you can spend additional discipline to apply a psi boost
          to it and enhance its effects. A psi boost's effects only last until the
          end of the turn which the ability is first used. You can apply multiple
          psi boosts to an ability, but only one instance of each specific boost.
          You can use the following psi boosts.
    
    
          ##### Dynamic Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability force moves a target, the forced movement distance gains a
          bonus equal to your Reason score.
    
          ##### Expanded Power (3 Clarity)
    
          If the ability targets an area, you increase the size of the area by 1. If
          the area is a line, you increase the size of one dimension, not both.
    
          ##### Extended Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability is ranged, the distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason
          score. If the ability is melee, the distance gains a +2 bonus.
    
          ##### Heightened Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability deals rolled damage, it deals extra damage equal to your
          Reason score.
    
          ##### Magnified Power (5 Clarity)
    
          If the ability has a potency, you increase that potency by an amount equal
          to your Reason score.
    
          ##### Shared Power (5 Clarity)
    
          If the ability targets individual creatures or objects, you target one
          additional creature or object within distance.
    
          ##### Sharpened Power (1 Clarity)
    
          If the ability has any power roll, that roll gains an edge.
