          Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't
          use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
          or more Victories or finish a respite.
    
    
          When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic
          below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your
          Victories.
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of
          essence equal to your Victories.

          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence

          Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature
          within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain
          1 essence.
    
          You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

          You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures,
          even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate
          with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but
          you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence
          them.
    
    
          Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to
          communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with
          the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and
          sensations that can't be overly specific.

          Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example,
          the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent
          1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to
          maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the
          ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the
          amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to
          the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent
          effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the
          encounter.
    
    
          You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative
          amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an
          ability at any time (no action required).
    
          If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect
          includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect
          to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a
          persistent ability.
    
          If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in
          one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if
          you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation,
          taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the
          ability.

      - effect: >-
          You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding
          your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they
          take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane
          object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return
          to Formlessness ability instead.
    
    
          Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire
          weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn.
          This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is
          wearing mostly metal.

          You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a freeform magic spell
          for a variety of situations. Choose one of the following magical effects:
    
    
          - You create a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason score or
          smaller.
    
          - You construct a place of shelter suitable for twenty creatures that
          lasts for 24 hours and can't be detected by enemies.
    
          - You restore all Stamina to a mundane object of a size equal to your
          Reason score or smaller.
    
          - Choose a cube with a size up to your Reason score within 5 squares. You
          can fill that area with difficult terrain or natural phenomena such as
          fire, water, or plant life, or can clear the area of those things.
    
          - You can preserve a corpse or up to 5 pounds of food for a week, or can
          cause a corpse or that amount of food to instantly rot.
    
          - You create a seal on a surface that can't be seen or felt by anyone but
          you. When a creature comes adjacent to the surface, you can see and hear
          through the seal for as long as the creature remains adjacent to it. When
          you create the seal, you can decide to limit the number of creatures who
          activate it by choosing a creature keyword (such as Undead) or a specific
          name (such as Ajax the Invincible) or organization (such as the Black Iron
          Pact). If you do, the seal alerts you only when creatures with the
          keyword, name, or organizational affiliation you provide pass by it. If
          you create a second seal, the first one disappears. You can dispel a seal
          at any time (no action required).

                  space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability.
                  If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as

          additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when
          they finish their next respite.
    
    
          Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes
          a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a
          treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an
          existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow
          these magic consumables on its own.
    
          As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an
          adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all
          their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and
          they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their
          aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit
          and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the
          creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for
          the longest time.

                  the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if
                  they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in
                  life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and
                  convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a
                  creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise
                  knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You
                  can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

          divine power on your abilities as if it were piety.
    
    
          Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any
          conduit abilities you don't have, as the gods answer your prayers with
          temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have
          that usually costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.
    
          Divine power remains until you spend it.

          You are now an avatar of your god! When you use your Prayer feature, you
          can be affected by up to three prayers at once, and you can change all
          those prayers and your ward as a respite activity. You can also use a
          maneuver to activate one of your domain effects (see Domain Piety and
          Effects) without needing to pray.
    
    
          Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
          in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
          can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer
          honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
          cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
          allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
          your deity.

          - Strikes with the weapon deal extra holy damage equal to the wielder's
          highest characteristic score.
    
          - Any creature struck by the weapon who has holy weakness and has P <
          STRONG is frightened and weakened (save ends).
    
          - Any minion targeted by a strike using the weapon dies. That minion's
          Stamina maximum is removed from the minion Stamina pool before any damage
          is applied to the rest of the squad.
    
          - The weapon's wielder can't be made frightened.

          You are the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the
          timescape. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can use a free
          triggered action to use a conduit domain effect (see [Domain Piety and
          Effects](#page-110-0) in the [Conduit](#page-108-0) section) associated
          with your chosen domain, or a domain you access with virtue (see below).
          If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your
          Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your
          censor level instead.
    
    
          Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest
          in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you
          can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer
          honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer
          cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your
          allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships
          your deity.
    
          While you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority
          targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge
          on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal
          to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you
          suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.

          Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use
          that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
          more Victories or finish a respite.
    
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus
          equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for
          the tactician, but they might appear in future products.)

          can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means
          taking the higher of two bonuses.)
    
          For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the
          following benefits overall:
    
          - Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon
    
          - Stability Bonus: +1
    
          - Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
    
          - Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4
    
          - Speed Bonus: +1
    
          - Ranged Distance Bonus: +10
    
          - Disengage Bonus: +1
    
          - You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.
    
          Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which
          might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you
          gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which
          gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which
          gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the
          Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from
          the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing
          its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to
          3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13
          damage.

          Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that
          knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you
          treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one
          category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such
          projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12:
          Downtime Projects for more information.)
    
    
          Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or
          negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the
          encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite
          activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:
        tier1: The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
        tier2: The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the
          encounter.
        tier3: The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the
          encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.
      - effect: "The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:"
        tier1: The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC
          in the negotiation.
        tier2: The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.
        tier3: The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each
          of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the
          negotiation.
      - effect: You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

          became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine,
          outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed.
          Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial
          traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield.
          Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics,
          you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which
          grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)
      - effect: Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine
          determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

                  The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until
                  you are dying, or until you use this ability again. You can
                  willingly end your mark on a creature (no action required), and if
                  another tactician marks a creature, your mark on that creature
                  ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you
                  can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within
                  distance.
    
                  You can initially mark only one creature using this ability,
                  though other tactician abilities allow you to mark additional
                  creatures at the same time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's
                  Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures
                  with this ability starting at 5th level.
    
                  While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you
                  and allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls
                  made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally
                  uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you,
                  you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a
                  free triggered action:
    
                  - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.
    
                  - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.
    
                  - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of
                  squares equal to your Reason score.
    
                  - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the
                  creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
    
                  You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.

          At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
          tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama
          equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat,
          you gain 1d3 drama.
    
    
          Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during a combat
          encounter:
    
          - The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn, you
          gain 2 drama.
    
          - The first time any hero is made winded during the encounter, you gain 2
          drama.
    
          - Whenever a creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20,
          you gain 3 drama.
    
          - When you or another hero dies, you gain 10 drama.
    
          When you are dead, you continue to gain drama during combat as long as
          your body is intact. If you have 30 drama during the encounter in which
          you died, you can come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action
          required). If you are still dead after the encounter in which you died,
          you can't gain drama during future encounters.
    
          You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

          Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use
          that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or
          more Victories or finish a respite.
    
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had
          spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.

              - effect: >-
                  Abilities like Guest Star, Missed Cue, and Twist at the End allow
                  the auteur to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by
                  temporarily removing creatures from an encounter, bringing people
                  back to life, or causing a new ally to appear. These abilities and
                  features are no more powerful than any other, but they're
                  narratively different from shooting rays of fire or swinging a
                  sword.
    
    
                  This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in *Draw
                  Steel*, the auteur knows that the combat encounter playing out at
                  your table is really a story being told sometime later, probably
                  in a tavern.
    
                  When the auteur uses these abilities, they are changing that
                  story. They rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the
                  telling. What *actually* happened is a matter of some debate. Even
                  the people who were there don't agree on exactly what took place.
                  How people *remember* it is what's important!
    
                  This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it's too weird for you
                  or your table, you could always interpret those abilities as a
                  kind of magic. A school of conjuring that really does change the
                  battlefield, which the auteur merely *flavors* as rewriting the
                  story.

          Whenever you obtain a success on a test to interact with an NPC using a
          skill from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that NPC.
          When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience
          increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a
          negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a
          bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a
          maximum of 5).
    
    
          You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a
          bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of
          your active bonds to lose.

          As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival (such as a
          calling card or a formal letter) addressed to an enemy. You can deliver
          the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area,
          send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to
          find. You can have only one notice active at a time.
    
    
          The Director determines when the target receives your notice. When the
          target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate
          measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per combat
          round during encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such
          encounter with 2 additional hero tokens (Chapter 1: The Basics). These
          hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.

          You can use your Scene Partner feature to form a bond with one willing
          hero instead of an NPC you interact with using a test. If you bond with
          another hero, you lose your existing bond with a hero.
    
    
          Additionally, you and creatures you are bonded with gain a +1 bonus to
          saving throws. Whenever you or a bonded creature succeeds on a saving
          throw, you and each creature you are bonded with gains temporary Stamina
          equal to your level.

          Although you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic
          abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you
          use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't
          use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
          or more Victories or finish a respite.
    
    
          When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
          insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if
          you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.

          At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to

          on your turn and uses your statistics, except they have 1 Stamina. They
          are affected by any conditions and effects on you, and last until the
          start of your next turn. A clone doesn't have insight and can't use the
          Careful Observation ability, the Umbral Form feature, or any triggered
          actions. On their turn, a clone has a move action, a maneuver, and a main
          action that they can use only to make a free strike. While making a free
          strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren't also
          striking.
    
    
          Outside of combat, you can have one clone active for every 2 Victories you
          have. If a clone is destroyed, you must wait 1 hour before creating

          on your turn, provided you pay the entire cost of the ability in vision.
          If you choose to use a psionic ability that usually costs no clarity, you
          must spend 1 vision to use it.

          distance gains a +2 bonus.

      - effect: >-
          As a maneuver, you project your mind outside your body. While you are in
          this state, your body remains unconscious and prone, and your mind is a
          separate entity with size 1T. Your mind automatically has concealment, and
          can freely move through solid matter. If you end your turn inside solid
          matter, you are forced out into the space where you entered it.
    
    
          Any abilities or features you use originate from your mind. Both your mind
          and your body can take damage while separated, with any such damage
          applied to your Stamina. Your mind is instantly forced back into your body
          if you take any damage, and you can immediately return to your body as a
          free maneuver.

          Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature is force
          moved, you gain 2 clarity instead of 1.
