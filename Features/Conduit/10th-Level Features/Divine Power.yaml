      You have an epic resource called divine power. Each time you finish a
      respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend
      divine power on your abilities as if it were piety.


      Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any
      conduit abilities you don't have, as the gods answer your prayers with
      temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have
      that usually costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.

      Divine power remains until you spend it.
