              A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within
              distance. The source takes their turn immediately after you,
              moving up to their speed and either taking a main action or a
              maneuver. The source is dismissed at the start of your next turn.

              The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains
              their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are
              dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain
              Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced
              to 0, you can't use this ability again until you earn 1 or more
              Victories.

              The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of
              your next turn.
