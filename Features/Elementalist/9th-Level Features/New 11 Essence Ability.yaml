              ###### The Green Defends Its Servants (11 Essence)

              *A luminous green shield shows its true beauty the more it
              cracks.*

              | **Green, Magic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |

              | ------------------------ | ----------------------: |

              | **📏 Ranged 10**         | **🎯 Self or one ally** |
          - name: Effect
            effect: You conjure an elemental shield that protects the target until the end
              of your next turn. While the shield is active, the target can take
              the Defend main action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The
              target gains 30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or
              until the effect ends. If this temporary Stamina disappears, the
              effect ends and the shield explodes, dealing 10 damage to each
              enemy within 5 squares of the target.
