              ###### Magma Titan (9 Essence)

              *Their body swells with lava, mud, and might, towering over their
              enemies.*

              | **Earth, Fire, Green, Magic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver**

          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following
              benefits:

              - Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target
              becoming size 3. Each creature who is within the target's new
              space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability.
              If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as
              they can and become restrained until the effect ends.

              - They have fire immunity 10.

              - Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason
              score.

              - When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced
              movement distance gains a +2 bonus.

              - They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for
              Might power rolls.
          - name: Persistent 2
            effect: >-
              The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Additionally,
              at the start of your turn, the target can spend 2 Recoveries.

              ###### Meteor (9 Essence)

              *You teleport the target into the air and let the ground and the
              elemental force of fire do the rest.*

              object** |
          - roll: Power Roll + Reason
            tier1: You teleport the target up to 4 squares.
            tier2: You teleport the target up to 6 squares.
            tier3: You teleport the target up to 8 squares.
          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              If the target is teleported to a space where they would fall, they
              immediately do so, treating the fall as if their Agility score
              were 0. The target takes fire damage from the fall, and each enemy
              within 3 squares of where they land takes the same amount of fire
              damage. The ground within 3 squares of where the target lands is
              difficult terrain.

              ###### The Wode Remembers and Returns (9 Essence)

              *You create a terrarium that spans from canopy above to underbrush
              below.*

              | **Area, Earth, Green, Magic, Void** | **Main action** |

              | ----------------------------------- | --------------: |

              | **📏 4 burst**                      |  **🎯 Special** |
          - name: Effect
            effect: The area becomes dark and verdant, with trees and plant life appearing
              in unoccupied spaces within it until the start of your next turn.
              The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and any ally who ends
              their turn in the area has cover.
          - name: Persistent 2
            effect: The area remains until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the
              start of your turn, each ally in the area can spend a Recovery.
