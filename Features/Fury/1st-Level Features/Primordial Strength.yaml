effects:
  - effect: >-
      Whenever you damage an object with a weapon strike, the strike deals extra
      damage equal to your Might score. Additionally, whenever you push another
      creature into an object, the creature takes extra damage equal to your
      Might score.


      As your ferocity grows, you gain benefits as noted on the Berserker
      Growing Ferocity table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved
      benefit replaces a lesser benefit.
