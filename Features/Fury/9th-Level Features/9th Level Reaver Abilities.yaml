            effect: Each enemy within 5 squares of you is distracted until the end of the
              round. While a creature is distracted this way, they can't take
              triggered actions or free triggered actions, ability rolls made
              against them gain an edge, and their characteristic scores are
              considered 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies.
