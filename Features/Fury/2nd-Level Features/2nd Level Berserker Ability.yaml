            effect: You vertically push the target up to 4 squares. This forced movement
              ignores the target's stability, and the target takes no damage
              from colliding with creatures or objects. At the end of this
              movement, the target can make a free strike that deals extra
              damage equal to your Might score.

              You move up to your speed in a straight line. During this
              movement, you can move through mundane structures, including
              walls, which are difficult terrain for you. You automatically
              destroy each square of structure you move through and leave behind
              a square of difficult terrain.

              Additionally, you make one power roll that targets each enemy you
              move adjacent to during this movement.
          - roll: Power Roll + Might
            tier1: Push 1
            tier2: Push 2
            tier3: Push 3
