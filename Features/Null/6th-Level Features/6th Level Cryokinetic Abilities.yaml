            effect: You can place this wall in occupied squares, sliding each creature in
              the area into the nearest unoccupied space of your choice. The
              wall remains until the end of the encounter or until you are
              dying. The wall's squares are treated as stone squares for the
              purpose of damage, and you and allies can move freely through the
              wall. Each enemy who enters a square adjacent to the wall and has
              M < AVERAGE is slowed (save ends). Each enemy who is force moved
              into the wall and has M < AVERAGE is restrained (save ends).
