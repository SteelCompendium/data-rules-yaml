            effect: Each target can teleport up to 5 squares. For each target in addition to
              you who teleports away from or into a space adjacent to an enemy,
              that enemy takes fire damage equal to your Agility score.
              Additionally, a target who ends this movement in concealment or
              cover can use the Hide maneuver even if they are observed.
