            effect: You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the
              creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The
              creature otherwise notices the bomb and can disarm and remove it
              as a main action. If they don't, at the end of your next turn, the
              bomb detonates. When the bomb detonates, you make a power roll
              targeting each enemy within 2 squares of it.

            tier1: 4 + A fire damage
