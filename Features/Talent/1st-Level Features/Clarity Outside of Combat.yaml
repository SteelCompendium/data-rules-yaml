      Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't
      use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
      or more Victories or finish a respite.


      Additionally, whenever you use any ability or effect that costs clarity
      within 1 minute of using another such ability, you take 1d6 damage and
      incur any strain effect from using the new ability. Whenever you use an
      ability with a strain effect outside of combat, you can take 1d6 damage
      and incur the effect if you don't incur it for other reasons.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you
      had spent an amount of clarity equal to your Victories.
