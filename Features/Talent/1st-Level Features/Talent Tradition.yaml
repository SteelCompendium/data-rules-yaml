      - **Telepathy** abilities allow you to communicate with, read, and
      influence the minds of other creatures.


      You choose a talent tradition from the following options: chronopathy,
      telekinesis, or telepathy. Your talent tradition is your subclass, and
      your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as
      you gain new levels. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future
      products.) (*Quick Build:* Telekinesis.)
