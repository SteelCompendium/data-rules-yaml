            effect: The target has damage weakness 5 until the end of your next turn.
              Whenever the target takes damage while they have this weakness,
              they are knocked prone.
          - name: Strained
            effect: This ability gains the Strike keyword as the vision hurts the target's

              The area is frozen in time until the start of your next turn. Each
              object in the area is restrained and can't fall until the effect
              ends. Until the effect ends, creatures in the area who are reduced
              to 0 Stamina or would die stay alive, and objects in the area that
              are reduced to 0 Stamina remain undestroyed.

              Make a power roll that targets each enemy in the area.
          - roll: Power Roll + Presence
            tier1: P < WEAK, the target is slowed until the effect ends
            tier2: P < AVERAGE, the target's speed is 0 until the effect ends
            tier3: P < STRONG, the target is restrained until the effect ends

            effect: Any creature or object force moved in the area takes 2 corruption damage

              restrained in the area can be force moved. You are restrained
              until the effect ends.
