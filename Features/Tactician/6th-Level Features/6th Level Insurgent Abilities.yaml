              If the target of the triggering ability is not a leader or solo
              creature, they are reduced to 0 Stamina. If the target of the
              triggering ability is a minion, the entire squad is killed. If the
              target of the triggering ability is a leader or solo creature, the
              triggering ability's power roll automatically obtains a tier 3
              outcome.
