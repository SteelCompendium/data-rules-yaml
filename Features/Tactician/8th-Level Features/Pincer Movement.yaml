    effect: When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you,
      you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike shift up to
      a number of squares equal to your Reason score before the strike is
      resolved. If you didn't make the strike, you can make this shift as well.
      If you did make the strike, one ally within 10 squares of you can make
      this shift as well.
