  - effect: You have trained your squad to maximize impact and break enemy lines
      when they attack.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: When you or any ally makes a melee strike against a creature marked by
      you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike push
      the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. That
      character can then shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason
      score, ending this shift adjacent to the target.
