              Each target gains 2 surges, and can use a free triggered action to
              use a signature ability that gains an edge. After resolving their
              ability, each target can shift up to 2 squares and become hidden
              even if they have no cover or concealment, or if they are
              observed.

              choosing, with each ability automatically obtaining a tier 3
              outcome on the power roll. After resolving the targets' abilities,
              you make a power roll against each original target.
