effects:
  - effect: Warfare is as old as civilizationâ€”and perhaps even older. As battle
      became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine,
      outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed.
      Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial
      traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield.
      Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics,
      you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which
      grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)
  - effect: Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine
      determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.
