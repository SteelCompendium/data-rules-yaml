      You enter every battle with a set of performance abilities at the ready.
      Performances are magical presentations (such as songs, dances, poems, or
      gymnastic feats) that your allies can participate in. These abilities have
      the Performance keyword. At the start of each combat round, as long as you
      are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either choose a new performance
      or maintain your current performance (no action required). Your
      performance lasts until you are unable to maintain it or until the end of
      the encounter.


      You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick performance
      abilities. Your choice of class act grants you additional performances.
