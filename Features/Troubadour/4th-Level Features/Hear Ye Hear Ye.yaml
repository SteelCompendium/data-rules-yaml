effects:
  - effect: "By bragging, intimidating, leading, or lying, you attempt to spread one
      piece of information into the local area. Make a Presence test:"
    tier1: Your information reaches no one.
    tier2: Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town size or
      larger. You and each ally present when you make the test gain an edge on
      Presence tests in that area until one of you spends a Recovery.
    tier3: Your information reaches the nearest populated area of town size or
      larger, plus the next closest such population. You and allies present for
      your test gain an edge on Presence tests made in those areas until you
      start your next respite.
