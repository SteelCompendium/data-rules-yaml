            effect: You and the target each make a melee free strike that targets each enemy
              within 3 squares of either of you, dividing the enemies between
              each of you. You choose which enemies your free strike targets and
              which enemies the target creature's free strike targets. You then
              slide the target 5 squares, ignoring stability.
