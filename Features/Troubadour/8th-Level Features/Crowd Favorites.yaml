              While this performance is active, each target who is dead can
              choose to continue taking turns after death. On each of their
              turns, a target can move and use either a main action or a
              maneuver, but can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions. At
              the end of the encounter, each target who chose to take turns this
              way turns to dust and blows away.

            effect: While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in
              the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that
              imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement
              distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per
              combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free
              triggered action.
