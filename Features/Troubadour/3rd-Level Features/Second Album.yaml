              While this performance is active, each target who starts their
              turn in the area doesn't take a bane on strikes against creatures
              with concealment. Once during their turn, they can search for
              hidden creatures as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter
              9: Tests).

              dying while in the area gains an edge on power rolls and ignores
              the effects of bleeding until the end of their turn.
