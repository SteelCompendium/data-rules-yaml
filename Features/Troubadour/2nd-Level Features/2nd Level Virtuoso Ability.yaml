              You use an ability that you have observed being used this combat
              round. The ability must have the Strike keyword, cost 5 or fewer
              of a Heroic Resource, and cost no Malice. When you make the
              strike, you use your Presence score for any power rolls, and any
              damage you deal is sonic damage.
