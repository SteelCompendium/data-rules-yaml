effects:
  - effect: Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use a
      main action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each
      ally can shift up to their speed, and ability rolls made against them have
      a double bane until the end of the combat round. Additionally, any
      surprised enemy is no longer surprised.
