            effect: "A guest star appears to help you during the encounter: either a
              bystander within distance uplifted by your magic, or a mysterious
              new hero who appears in an unoccupied space within distance. This
              guest star is controlled by you, has their own turn, and shares
              your characteristics. Their Stamina maximum is half yours. They
              have no abilities other than your melee and ranged free strikes.
              At the end of the encounter, or when the guest star is reduced to
              0 Stamina, they retreat or revert to a bystander. The same
              bystander can't be uplifted this way more than once during an
              encounter."

            effect: A target who is not a leader or solo creature comes back to life with
              half their Stamina and becomes an ally under the Director's
              control. The players can work with the Director to determine when
              the target takes their turn each combat round. At the end of the
              encounter, the target turns to dust and is blown away.
