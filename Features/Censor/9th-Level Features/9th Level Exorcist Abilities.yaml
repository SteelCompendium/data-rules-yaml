              This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and
              creatures not native to your current world. If you know the
              target's true name, this ability has a double edge. While
              banished, the target is sent to another manifold in the timescape
              and removed from the encounter map. A banished target can do
              nothing but make saving throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time
              they do so. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished,
              they are lost to the timescape.
