              If the target is already frightened of you or another creature and
              this ability would frighten them again, they instead take psychic
              damage equal to twice your Presence score.

              *You channel holy energy to harm unbelievers and reveal those
              hidden from your judgment.*

            effect: Each target takes holy damage equal to twice your Presence score.
              Additionally, each hidden target is automatically revealed and
              can't become hidden again until the start of your next turn. You
              can then use your Judgment ability against one target as a free
              triggered action.
