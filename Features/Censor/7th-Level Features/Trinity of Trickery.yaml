            effect: You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere
              within distance. These duplicates last until the end of the
              encounter. On each of their turns, the target can move each
              duplicate up to their speed. If the target is targeted by an
              ability, they can use a free triggered action to switch places
              with a duplicate within their line of effect, making the duplicate
              the target of the ability instead. When either duplicate takes
              damage, it is destroyed.
